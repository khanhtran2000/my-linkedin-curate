3	3	6	In this post, lets review the storage systems in general..Storage systems fall into three broad categories: Block storage File storage Object storageThe diagram below compares 3 different storage systems. Block storage came first, in the 1960s. Common storage devices like hard disk drives (HDD) and solid-state drives (SSD) that are physically attached to servers are all considered as block storage.Block storage presents the raw blocks to the server as a volume. This is the most flexible and versatile form of storage. The server can format the raw blocks and use them as a file system, or it can hand control of those blocks to an application. Some applications like a database or a virtual machine engine manage these blocks directly in order to squeeze every drop of performance out of them.Block storage is not limited to physically attached storage. Block storage could be connected to a server over a high-speed network or over industry-standard connectivity protocols like Fibre Channel (FC) and iSCSI. Conceptually, the network-attached block storage still presents raw blocks. To the servers, it works the same as physically attached block storage. Whether to a network or physically attached, block storage is fully owned by a single server. It is not a shared resource. File storage is built on top of block storage. It provides a higher-level abstraction to make it easier to handle files and directories. Data is stored as files under a hierarchical directory structure. File storage is the most common general-purpose storage solution. File storage could be made accessible by a large number of servers using common file-level network protocols like SMB/CIFS and NFS. The servers accessing file storage do not need to deal with the complexity of managing the blocks, formatting volume, etc. The simplicity of file storage makes it a great solution for sharing a large number of files and folders within an organization. Object storage is new. It makes a very deliberate tradeoff to sacrifice performance for high durability, vast scale, and low cost. It targets relatively cold data and is mainly used for archival and backup. Object storage stores all data as objects in a flat structure. There is no hierarchical directory structure. Data access is normally provided via a RESTful API. It is relatively slow compared to other storage types. Most public cloud service providers have an object storage offering, such as AWS S3, Google block storage, and Azure blob storage.If you have any questions, please leave a comment.Please follow me if you want to receive weekly updates about tech interviews, system design, or book writing.

4	3	6	How does the Domain Name System (DNS) lookup work?.DNS acts as an address book. It translates human-readable domain names (google.com) to machine-readable IP addresses (142.251.46.238).To achieve better scalability, the DNS servers are organized in a hierarchical tree structure.There are 3 basic levels of DNS servers:1. Root name server (.). It stores the IP addresses of Top Level Domain (TLD) name servers. There are 13 logical root name servers globally.2. TLD name server. It stores the IP addresses of authoritative name servers. There are several types of TLD names. For example, generic TLD (.com, .org), country code TLD (.us), test TLD (.test).3. Authoritative name server. It provides actual answers to the DNS query. You can register authoritative name servers with domain name registrar such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.The diagram below illustrates how DNS lookup works under the hood:1. google.com is typed into the browser, and the browser sends the domain name to the DNS resolver.2. The resolver queries a DNS root name server.3. The root server responds to the resolver with the address of a TLD DNS server. In this case, it is .com.4. The resolver then makes a request to the .com TLD.5. The TLD server responds with the IP address of the domains name server, google.com (authoritative name server).6. The DNS resolver sends a query to the domains nameserver.7. The IP address for google.com is then returned to the resolver from the nameserver.8. The DNS resolver responds to the web browser with the IP address (142.251.46.238) of the domain requested initially.DNS lookups on average take between 20-120 milliseconds to complete (according to YSlow).If there is any specific topic you want me to cover, please leave a topic.Please follow me if you want to receive weekly updates about tech interviews, system design, or book writing.

5	3	6	What happens when you type a URL into your browser?The diagram below illustrates the steps.1. Bob enters a URL into the browser and hits Enter. In this example, the URL is composed of 4 parts: scheme - ://. This tells the browser to send a connection to the server using HTTP. domain - .. This is the domain name of the site. path - /. It is the path on the server to the requested resource: phone. resource - . It is the name of the resource Bob wants to visit.2. The browser looks up the IP address for the domain with a domain name system (DNS) lookup. To make the lookup process fast, data is cached at different layers: browser cache, OS cache, local network cache, and ISP cache.2.1 If the IP address cannot be found at any of the caches, the browser goes to DNS servers to do a recursive DNS lookup until the IP address is found (this will be covered in another post).3. Now that we have the IP address of the server, the browser establishes a TCP connection with the server.4. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server. The request looks like this: / /1.1: .5. The server processes the request and sends back the response. For a successful response (the status code is 200). The HTML response might look like this:/1.1 200 : , 30  2022 00:01:01 : -: /; =-8<! >< =""> </>6. The browser renders the HTML content.If you have any questions, please leave a comment.Please follow me if you want to receive weekly updates about tech interviews, system design, or book writing.

7	3	6	DeepMind says its new AI coding engine (AlphaCode) is as good as an average programmer..The AI bot participated in the 10 Codeforces coding competitions and was ranked 54.3%. It means its score exceeded half of the human contestants. If we look at its score of the last 6 months, AlphaCode ranks at 28%.The diagram below explains how the AI bot works:1. Pre-train the transformer models on GitHub code.2. Fine-tune the models on the relatively small competitive programming dataset.3. At evaluation time, create a massive amount of solutions for each problem.4. Filter, cluster, and rerank the solutions to a small set of candidate programs (at most 10), and then submit for further assessments.5. Run the candidate programs against the test cases, evaluate the performance, and choose the best one.Do you think AI bot will be better at Leetcode or competitive programming than software engineers five years from now?

8	3	6	There are two common ways to implement the read replica pattern:..1. Embed the routing logic in the application code (explained in the last post).2. Use database middleware.We focus on option 2 here. The middleware provides transparent routing between the application and database servers. We can customize the routing logic based on difficult rules such as user, schema, statement, etc.The diagram below illustrates the setup:1. When Alice places an order on amazon, the request is sent to Order Service.2. Order Service does not directly interact with the database. Instead, it sends database queries to the database middleware.3. The database middleware routes writes to the primary database. Data is replicated to two replicas.4. Alice views the order details (read). The request is sent through the middleware.5. Alice views the recent order history (read). The request is sent through the middleware.The database middleware acts as a proxy between the application and databases. It uses standard MySQL network protocol for communication.Pros:- Simplified application code. The application doesnt need to be aware of the database topology and manage access to the database directly.- Better compatibility. The middleware uses the MySQL network protocol. Any MySQL compatible client can connect to the middleware easily. This makes database migration easier.Cons:- Increased system complexity. A database middleware is a complex system. Since all database queries go through the middleware, it usually requires a high availability setup to avoid a single point of failure.- Additional middleware layer means additional network latency. Therefore, this layer requires excellent performance.Real-world example from Shopify: https://lnkd.in/gdazbPWCIf you have any questions, please leave a comment.Please follow me if you want to receive weekly updates about tech interviews, system design, or book writing.

9	3	6	In this post, we talk about a simple yet commonly used database design pattern (setup):   ...In this setup, all data-modifying commands like insert, delete, or update are sent to the primary DB, and reads are sent to read replicas.The diagram below illustrates the setup:1. When Alice places an order on amazon, the request is sent to Order Service.2. Order Service creates a record about the order in the primary DB (write). Data is replicated to two replicas.3. Alice views the order details. Data is served from a replica (read).4. Alice views the recent order history. Data is served from a replica (read).There is one major problem in this setup:  .Under certain circumstances (network delay, server overload, etc.), data in replicas might be seconds or even minutes behind. In this case, if Alice immediately checks the order status (query is served by the replica) after the order is placed, she might not see the order at all. This leaves Alice confused. In this case, we need read-after-write consistency.Possible solutions to mitigate this problem:1 Latency-sensitive reads are sent to the primary database.2 Reads that immediately follow writes are routed to the primary database.3 A relational DB generally provides a way to check if a replica is caught up with the primary. If data is up to date, query the replica. Otherwise, fail the read request or read from the primary.Real-world example.

75	10	3	Why are pie charts (potentially) dangerous?I enjoyed reading the article, The issue with pie charts (link in the comments), which showcases a BIG problem. Look at the 3 pie charts!They look almost identical. But if you check out the bar plots below, you can immediately see the difference:1. Increasing trend 2. Flat trend 3. Decreasing trend So what are you to do?Well one of the things that helped me become a better storyteller was learning plotting using Rs ggplot library. Now I know what youre thinking, well how does that help me become a better visual storyteller?When you learn ggplot, you learn:1. Grammar of Plotting - Ggplot forces you to use a strict grammar of graphics. 2. Geoms are basic - The visualization choice is called a geom. These geoms are basic units that help us build complex visualizations. 3. Pie chart is discouraged - In ggplot, you really only use a few main geoms: line, bar/column, point. Sure there are more , but those 3 are the most frequent. From there we learn how to craft amazing plots by applying scales, themes, and annotations. But thats it! And mastering the 3 simple geoms actually helps you become an amazing storyteller. Now R, ggplot, and its 20,000 other libraries can take a long time to learn. In fact, it took me 5-years (yikes). But thats why I made a free 40-minute webinar that consolidates what took me years to learn into a short value-packed presentation. (Link in the comments)Alright, I hope this helps a few of you. Your friendly neighborhood data scientist,Matt Dancho P.S. Ive left a link to the article, The issue with pie charts in the comments. P.P.S.

34	2	3	Mining business data for new and actionable insights is useful for ANY professional. Take one of my favorite data mining techniques - market basket analysis (MBA).I'm constantly amazed at how little MBA is used by professionals to analyze their data. MBA is easy to learn, flexible, and produces insights perfect for data stories.Regarding ease of learning, check out my MBA with Excel YouTube tutorial  designed for ANY professional.In terms of flexibility, MBA can be used for:1 - Exploration. It truly is a data mining technique. Give MBA your business data and it will return potentially interesting insights.2 - Prediction. You can hold a column of data fixed and then ask MBA to use all the other columns to find any potentially interesting insights. This will be clearer with an example.Imagine your are a product manager for a SaaS company. You can use MBA to mine all of your customer attributes/feature usages to see which combinations are most highly associated with paid conversion.Lastly, MBA produces metrics that are both simple and compelling for decision-makers. Continuing with the product manager example, the MBA analysis finds that a certain combination of characteristics and feature usages are 7.3 times more likely associated with paid conversion than other combinations (i.e., the lift metric).Just the thing to include in your data stories, no?Interested in learning more?

36	2	3	Leadership commitment to cultural change is the primary litmus test for a data literacy program. In my client work "cultural change" is not a buzz term. It has a practical implication - changing manager incentives.Consider the following:"If you can shift your managers decision-making from intuition to data by granting faster project approvals or larger budgets for proposals made using data-driven thinking, you will quickly get the behavior you seek from your managers through incentive alignment."The above quote comes from the article "How Data Literate is Your Company?" published by the Harvard Business Review. It is well worth your time to give it a google and a read.The above quote captures two fundamental ideas required for successful data literacy programs:1 - Managers must demonstrate the data literacy mindset each and every day through their actions.2 - Managers, like all employees, optimize their actions based on their incentives.Here are two more practical examples by changing manager performance reviews to include: Qualitative assessments and rewards from the manager's manager for: 1) Usage of business experiments. 2) Embodying the data literacy mindset. 3) Fostering a data literacy with their team. Rewards based on anonymous feedback from the manager's employees evaluating: 1) Usage of business experiments. 2) Embodying the data literacy mindset. 3) Fostering a data literacy with their team.Is your organization committed to becoming a data-driven culture?Stay healthy and happy data sleuthing!#dataliteracy #datadriven #leadership #data #analytics	2022-02-14 01:04:56-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

38	2	3	I will be teaching a data literacy bootcamp this April designed for ANY professional. What makes this bootcamp different is a focus on data analysis in addition to data visualization and data storytelling.If you have basic Excel skills, you will learn how to analyze data to answer questions like:[HR] - Is the bad attrition rate of Org A actually higher than Org B?[Product Management] - Did recent feature enhancements actually increase feature usage?[Customer Service] - Has there actually been a change in call volumes sufficient to effect staffing?[Marketing] - Did changing the ad copy actually improve things (i.e., no A/B test required)?[Supply Chain] - Are there actual differences between the shipping error rates of DC A vs DC B?The bootcamp is designed for flexibility, you can take 1, 2, or 3 of the following courses: Data visualization fundamentals Data storytelling Business analysis with ExcelProfessionals that take all 3 courses will earn a data literacy certificate.BTW - The skills learned in the bootcamp are 100% applicable to professionals that use tools like Excel, Tableau, and Power BI.Make 2022 the year you have more impact at work with data.Learn more about the bootcamp here: https://lnkd.in/gicbcxQYStay healthy and happy data sleuthing!#dataliteracy #datastorytelling #businessanalytics #excel #analytics	2022-02-14 01:04:56-05	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQFRVn9zDo37VQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1644329821306?e=1647475200&v=beta&t=DQCbskkZGrj6addxQm6kq7Pnqs96zTKMnKoHZygNJcc	Image
39	2	3	The first step in becoming a data literate professional is learning to apply simple data analysis techniques to your business data. Take diagnostic analytics. It's just a fancy name for a relatively simple idea.The goal of diagnostic analytics is to ascertain the "why" of something that happened in the business - the minimum bar for true data literacy.The good news is that any professional can learn to perform diagnostic analytics using the world's most common data tool - Microsoft Excel. Here's a simple process for conducting diagnostic analytics:1 - Formulate a very specific business question.2 - Gather/get access to data that will help you answer the business question.3 - Employ exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques guided by your business question.4 - As needed, goto 2.It is common for this process to generate more business questions - don't get distracted!Make note of these questions for follow-up EDA and continue diagnosing your current question.If you're not familiar with EDA, but have basic Excel skills, check out my YouTube tutorial series .1000s of professionals have used these tutorials to jumpstart their data literacy journeys.Make 2022 the year you have more business impact with data.Stay healthy and happy data sleuthing!#dataliteracy #excel #analytics #businessanalytics #dataanalytics	2022-02-14 01:04:56-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc
40	2	3	"But why the h**l do you suggest Excel as the underlying tool? You know better than anyone that there are more effective solutions available on the market today to tackle data analysis and visualization problems."The  is an actual quote from a comment in response to some of my content. Why indeed?A big focus for me in 2022 is to raise the data literacy of ALL organizations and professionals. Here's a shortlist of reasons why I might focus on Microsoft Excel:1 - Excel has excellent visualization support for exploratory data analysis (EDA), a fundamental data skill. Check out my YouTube tutorial series to learn more.2 - The single best data analysis technique for business professionals, the mighty process behavior chart, is easily implemented in Excel. I know because I teach a class on this.3 - The one and only Brent Dykes used Excel for the visualizations in his masterwork, "Effective Data Storytelling."4 - The Analysis ToolPak enables any professional to apply linear regression analysis to their business data. I know because I teach a class on this.5 - The Solver enables any professional to apply logistic regression analysis to their business data. I know because I teach a class on this.6 - Skills with Excel makes learning SQL easy. Check out my YouTube tutorial series to learn more.7 - Skills with Excel makes learning R easy. I know because I have an online course that teaches this.8 - I have YouTube tutorials that teach how to use Excel to conduct market basket analysis, RFM analysis, k-means clustering, and Naive Bayes classification.Oh, and one last thing.There are 700+ million Excel users worldwide. If widespread data literacy is contingent on moving all of these professionals to a tool like Tableau or Power BI, how successful am I going to be?Take it from a former software engineer/architect and hands-on analytics consultant/educator.Excel is here to stay and is the only rational choice for up-leveling data literacy.Stay healthy and happy data sleuthing!#dataliteracy #excel #analytics #businessanalytics #businessintelligence	2022-02-14 01:04:56-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc
41	2	3	I talk a lot about how business experimentation is a cultural trait of truly data literate organizations. While this might seem like lofty words, for me it has a very real implication.In this post I will attempt to illustrate what I mean with a hypothetical, yet realistic, example.While a bit cliche, I will use the example of a supermarket chain with many retail locations.Let's say that a member of the leadership team (e.g., a category executive) has been briefed on a data analysis that shows there is a strong purchase association between peanut butter and jelly.There may be some eye rolls at this point, please bear with me.Further, the leader is briefed on 3 ways to potentially exploit this association to increase the sales of both products:1 - Move the products to be next to each other on the store shelves.2 - Run a coupon campaign.3 - Special displays of both products at the end of store aisles.After some discussion with her team, the leader chooses to go with 2.Subsequent data analysis shows that the coupon campaign had no substantive effect on the sales of either product.Given the size of the supermarket chain, the cost of the experiment was non-trivial.In many organizations, a leader in this situation would be concerned of the perception of failure. The leader might even choose to: Play the "blame game" Obfuscate or misrepresent the dataIn a culture of business experimentation, this leader would have no fear. A culture of business experimentation expects, and rewards, data-driven experiments that increases the organization's knowledge.In this case, a coupon campaign doesn't appear to be an effective way to boost sales of peanut butter and jelly.In such a culture, the leader would proudly present the experiment and findings in her next quarterly business review (QBR).NOTE - This isn't a license for leaders to get away with pet projects that have no ROI. I use the words "data-driven business experiments" deliberately.Does your organization reward leaders for business experimentation?Stay healthy and happy data sleuthing!#dataliteracy #datadriven #analytics #businessanalytics #dataanalytics	2022-02-14 01:04:56-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

I would go so far as to say most dashboards.If you build dashboards in tools like Excel, Tableau, or Power BI, do yourself a favor and follow the content of Brent Dykes. Brent had a great post last Friday on the use of contrast - something I rarely see used in Production dashboards.The most successful executive dashboards that I've created are essentially static. Their purpose is to tell the story of the business using 3-5 well-crafted KPIs and are often used as part of leadership meeting agendas.Given the audience, these are some of the most challenging dashboards to create. They need to tell great stories with a minimal amount of ink. Now, let me ask you this.If data visualization fundamentals are critical for crafting successful executive dashboards, why wouldn't you build all your dashboards this way?Stay healthy and happy data sleuthing!#dataliteracy #excel #businessintelligence #analytics #businessanalytics	2022-02-21 09:09:42-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

83	2	3	One of the most rewarding things I do is help organizations make better decisions using data. I'm always on the lookout for new tools to add to my analytics tool belt. The book  added another tool.The book is an introduction to bayesian networks for MBA students to model and evaluate decisions. While there is math in the book, it is quite approachable to many professionals.What I found particularly intriguing about the book was how it comfortably incorporates qualitative knowledge gleaned from business subject matter experts into the decision models.For example, using probability estimates from business SMEs where no quantitative data exists. The book illustrates how both qualitative and quantitative data can be easily incorporated into decision models.In my experience, the ability to include business SMEs in the modeling process increases the chance that the model will get buy-in from decision makers.The only downside to the book is that the commercial software mentioned for visually building/evaluating decisions models are quite expensive. If anyone knows of free graphical tools for building/evaluating bayesian networks, would you be so kind as to mention the software in a comment?BTW - Yes, I took the book on my holiday vacation for beach reading.

121	2	3	Key performance indicators (KPIs) are a raw material of data literate organizations. Rigorous use of KPIs, including analysis, allows data literate leaders to answer the 2 most important questions they have.The first question - "Is it working?"While cliche, the only constant in business is change. There are always new products, internal programs, marketing campaigns, promotions, etc.Rigorous use of KPIs allow leaders to quickly ascertain (e.g., via executive dashboards) whether the new thing is moving the needle for the business. Which leads to the second question -"Why isn't it working?"Data literate organizations rigorously analyze their KPIs in pursuit of discovering the "why" of what is going on in the business. They accomplish this via a standardized, repeatable form of Diagnostic Analytics.BTW - The rules of KPI analysis can be learned by ANY professional and are well-known to data literate managers.In keeping with my philosophy, the above most definitely fits into the 80/20 Rule of analytics.If your organization is tackling data literacy in 2022, start with KPIs.Stay healthy and happy data sleuthing!#dataliteracy #datadriven #analytics #businessanalytics #dataanalytics	2022-02-19 08:20:20-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

84	3	6	What happens when you upload a file to Amazon S3?..Before we dive into the design, lets define some terms.. A logical container for objects. The bucket name is globally unique. To upload data to S3, we must first create a bucket.. An object is an individual piece of data we store in a bucket. It contains object data (also called payload) and metadata. Object data can be any sequence of bytes we want to store. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object.An S3 object consists of (Figure 1): Metadata. It is mutable and contains attributes such as ID, bucket name, object name, etc. Object data. It is immutable and contains the actual data.In S3, an object resides in a bucket. The path looks like this: /bucket-to-share/script.txt. The bucket only has metadata. The object has metadata and the actual data.The diagram below (Figure 2) illustrates how file uploading works. In this example, we first create a bucket named bucket-to-share and then upload a file named script.txt to the bucket.1. The client sends an HTTP PUT request to create a bucket named bucket-to-share. The request is forwarded to the API service.2. The API service calls Identity and Access Management (IAM) to ensure the user is authorized and has WRITE permission.3. The API service calls the metadata store to create an entry with the bucket info in the metadata database. Once the entry is created, a success message is returned to the client.4. After the bucket is created, the client sends an HTTP PUT request to create an object named script.txt.5. The API service verifies the users identity and ensures the user has WRITE permission on the bucket.6. Once validation succeeds, the API service sends the object data in the HTTP PUT payload to the data store. The data store persists the payload as an object and returns the UUID of the object.7. The API service calls the metadata store to create a new entry in the metadata database. It contains important metadata such as the object_id (UUID), bucket_id (which bucket the object belongs to), object_name, etc.Question: what database do you think is good for the metadata store?Disclaimer: I have no idea how Amazon S3 works internally.This is based on a lot of research and the design only reflects my own thoughts.

An algorithm cant tell you what comes next or give you feedback.2. Talk to people around you. Its ready isolating to try to solve your career alone. Others have really good input and stories.3. Its hard to lean on others when youre struggling. But if you can start with 1 person to confide in, the relief you feel is palpable.4. Check out LinkedIn and find some career switchers that show a path you could take. Reach out to them to talk! Youll be surprised at the response.5. Spend time doing reflection.

90	9	2	In a Data Engineering system, having a producer-consumer model is pretty common. Since the consumption rate is pretty much unknownor varies a lot or is usually decoupled system, a common design principle is to bring a queue in-between.Now a producer can generate the data and push the data to a queue & many clients can simultaneously read the data at their speed & time.Well, thats not the end of the story. The Data Engineering story starts after that. A producer may generate an immense amount of uncontrollable data which consumers may never catch up with, which can eventually create congestion in the network and can bring down the entire system.- the producer is losing data somehow or the data order is somehow compromised.- the producer is too slow & consumers are waiting & wasting resources - The queue grew significantly big & expensive.While building a data engineering system, there are many ways to break a Streaming System. There are many technologies to solve the problem but usually, that means adding more components to the infrastructure.

194	9	2	What is Log-Structured Merge Trees - Core Data Structure behind Distributed StorageWith traditional btree variants, inserts are very fast while the data set remains in cache, but once the tree overflows the cache, performance drops significantly. There are two factors involved:- once the data fills the cache, new inserts have some probability of going to a page that is not in the cache, requiring a read- the cache is full of dirty pages, so pages have to be written to free space in the cache before the read can be satisfied.How?- A logical tree is split into several physical pieces so that the most-recently-updated portion of data is in a tree that fits entirely in memory. - Once the in-memory tree reaches a threshold size, a new in-memory tree is created and the old tree synced to disk. Once written to disk, trees are read-only, though they are merged in the background with other on-disk trees to reduce the cost of reads.- With this structure, "blind writes" can be performed entirely on the in-memory tree. Deletes are implemented by inserting a special "tombstone" record into the in-memory tree.

In a distributed application, if a process could read the data directly from virtual memory, the processes can save many expensive CPU cycles by avoiding reading data from Memory or disk which are very slow.Deep Learning applications usually have many iterations, so if those processes follow a weak isolation model & manage to read the data directly from the virtual memory of another process, then the performance will be significantly better.	2022-02-14 15:49:33-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

Consensus involves multiple servers agreeing on values. Once they reach a decision on a value, that decision is final.Raft is a consensus algorithm which is an easier version of Paxos.Core consensus properties are - All processes eventually agree on the same value- The selected value must be the "right" value Join#lifescienceslack group to learn morehttps://lnkd.in/eRWvzW7C Read around#dataengineeringhttps://lnkd.in/e289jhdw Join Telegram#datainfrastructurecommunityhttps://t.me/datainfra	2022-02-14 15:49:33-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

Keep good people is the single highest ROI activity a company can focus on. It should be prioritized alongside any major project!2. Pay and incentivize them as if they are getting other offers. Be open with them about this. Show you understand their value by openly discussing if/when other opportunities arise.3. Onboarding a data professional is critical. Make them feel comfortable and part of something early and you have a better chance at retaining them.4. Help them avoid burnout. People leave data roles frequently because they are overwhelmed or on the wrong project. Where possible, align them with their interests.5. Provide a long term vision for them. Show them where you see them headed with your company! Show steps to promotion. It matters!Retaining awesome people is really tough. But its a key conversation. How do you approach it?

This model can simplify the burden of accidental load or crashes.- With infra defined control group, a data scientist can simply focus on her work without any concern on data security/privacy.- Can deploy or experiment with any new ML technology in the same infrastructure without any delay, just a Dockerfile- Can be part of multi-tenancy and use shared resources or dedicated resources as required.- Can run 100s of containers without creating any chaos in the infra- Deploying the code in Production is no different from testing, just a new context or tenant, etc.- With k8s, data scientists can simply deploy their web applications and make them available to group/company/internet by inheriting the Ingres template within 5 minutes.- A Data scientist can get for certain kinds of nodes GPU CPU for experiments without too much hassle.Not every k8s setup is same, but I am assuming templating and many other enforced security policies by the Infra team.	2022-02-14 15:49:33-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

284	9	2	Operation System Memory Management - Why Do you even need Virtual Memory?Operating System is designed for multitasking & to load multiple programs, each program must be assigned with dedicated storage from the memory. "We can't directly use Hard Drive, which has much more storage, for memory allocation because HDD is slow, even SSDs are slower."Main Memory Design:The main memory is a long list of blocks where each block contains binary data & marked it a serial number known as Memory Address.The range of Memor Address used by a Program is known as the Address Space.Core Problems with Main memory:1. Not Enough Memory"Usually, in a 32-bit system, each program is assigned with 2^32 bits (~4GB) memory but if you are running more than 100s of programs, RAM is not enough to allocate memory."2. Memory FragmentationPrograms are contiguous memory hungry. Assigning programs with a memory address, usually leave empty blocks in-between & the available space becomes fragmented into smaller and smaller chunks. Eventually, there is not enough contiguous space left to assign a program with enough memory.3. SecurityYou never want a program to overwrite the space of another program. Complete Isolation is one of the fundamentals of Operating systems.These are the core reasons for bringing a new concept called Virtual Memory ( Next Session) Join#lifescienceslack group to learn morehttps://lnkd.in/eRWvzW7C Read around#dataengineeringhttps://lnkd.in/e289jhdw Join Telegram#datainfrastructurecommunityhttps://t.me/datainfra	2022-03-01 04:04:44-05	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQFmtLZjOmDV5g/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1646125272964?e=1649289600&v=beta&t=7Wl9zQlhsRjVIKub3ghTLByVbZN8sbh-5rZzMfjLW2k	Image
124	3	6	A really cool technique thats commonly used in object storage such as S3 to improve durability is called  . Lets take a look at how it works...Erasure coding deals with data durability differently from replication. It chunks data into smaller pieces (placed on different servers) and creates parities for redundancy. In the event of failures, we can use chunk data and parities to reconstruct the data. Lets take a look at a concrete example (4 + 2 erasure coding) as shown in Figure 1.1 Data is broken up into four even-sized data chunks d1, d2, d3, and d4.2 The mathematical formula is used to calculate the parities p1 and p2. To give a much simplified example, p1 = d1 + 2*d2 - d3 + 4*d4 and p2 = -d1 + 5*d2 + d3 - 3*d4.3 Data d3 and d4 are lost due to node crashes.4 The mathematical formula is used to reconstruct lost data d3 and d4, using the known values of d1, d2, p1, and p2.How much extra space does erasure coding need? For every two chunks of data, we need one parity block, so the storage overhead is 50% (Figure 2). While in 3-copy replication, the storage overhead is 200% (Figure 2).Does erasure coding increase data durability? Lets assume a node has a 0.81% annual failure rate. According to the calculation done by Backblaze, erasure coding can achieve 11 nines durability vs 3-copy replication can achieve 6 nines durability.What other techniques do you think are important to improve the scalability and durability of an object store such as S3?Please follow me if you want to know the progress of the book.

Informationis prepared data that has been processed, aggregated and organized into a more human-friendly format that provides more context. Insightsare generated byanalyzinginformation and drawing conclusions. Both data and information set the stage for the discovery of insights that can then influence decisions and drive change.In its most basic form, actionable insights are meaningful findings that result from raw data in your analytics tool.Few tips to help get you started:-Define your goals and objectives-Invest in the right analytics and attribution tools-Use context to simplify data-Use visuals to show your findingsWhat is your prefered tool to find insights from Data?#datascience	2022-02-15 20:04:53-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

I had a presentation for R/Finance where I was going to present a Shiny App that I was working on. I updated my R softwareBig mistake. My shiny app suddenly stopped working and I went into straight panic-mode. This was before I knew how to use GitHub & Docker like I do now. So I was freaking out. I was sitting in a Starbucks in Chicago. Miles away from home. Beads of sweat instantly started to form. The barista asks if I need anything. I muster a no thanks. And try not to scream. That night, I figured it out. You know what it was?One of the args to a function changed names. My app wasnt able to fetch data. WTF developers. This is a cruel trick. Ok. After the heat dissipated. I fixed the issue. Disaster averted. But this single problem that cost me a day of work AND taught me a valuable lesson. Never update RLol, Im kidding. What it really taught me wasProtect yourself. Learning tools like Docker & Git can save you countless hours when in production orwhen you are about to present an awesome Shiny app to 500 data scientists and the most powerful folks in finance. The good news is I eventually learned Docker, Git, and a lot more. If you ever felt like this, or even if you havent but you know you are down the path that I was - updating software without a care in the world for your production code.

95	8	1	Data is your most valuable asset, but only if you make the most of it.Datais the raw and unprocessed facts that are usually in the form of numbers and text. Informationis prepared data that has been processed, aggregated and organized into a more human-friendly format that provides more context. Insightsare generated byanalyzinginformation and drawing conclusions. Both data and information set the stage for the discovery of insights that can then influence decisions and drive change.In its most basic form, actionable insights are meaningful findings that result from raw data in your analytics tool.Few tips to help get you started:-Define your goals and objectives-Invest in the right analytics and attribution tools-Use context to simplify data-Use visuals to show your findingsWhat is your prefered tool to find insights from Data?image: Harvard Uni Blog#datascience	2022-02-16 20:27:45-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

111	9	2	What is JIT or JUST-IN-TIME Compiler? - Little more than a compilerJIT  - "Compilation is done during execution of a program (at run time) rather than prior to execution"Technically JIT is a compilation technique where the compiler runs in the same process as the application. This leads to sharing the same resources assigned for the application.- JIT compiles code at the runtime meaning exactly before the actual code instruction is being used, but with speed and performance compared to interpreted language.- JIT is an extra step before running the actual process but it brings  valuable information which finally optimizes the overall runtimeSide Note:An interpreter directly executes the code whereas a compiler transforms the high-level code to another form, usually machine code (directly read by a computer).

152	2	3	Predictive analytics skills are useful for ANY professional interested in having more impact at work with data. To help build these skills, I have a real-world predictive analytics project available on my YouTube channel.With all the hype around machine learning and AI, it is easy to forget that predictive analytics can also be used to gain insights into the "why" of what's going on in the business:[HR] - What are the important factors that predict promotion velocity?[Product Management] - What feature usage(s) are highly predictive of a sticky SaaS customer?[Marketing] - Which factors have the most impact on customer lifetime value (CLV)?[Customer Service] - Can we handle more calls with a different mix of agents?[Supply Chain] - What are the factors that predict customer returns?The project below is based on my hands-on analytics work at a previous employer. The project has all the things: Freely available data from US government agencies. Data in different formats that need to be cleaned, transformed, and merged. A very specific business question to be answered via predictive analytics. You can use tools like Excel, SQL, R, Python, etc. to work on the project. Can be a great addition to a project portfolio.Interested in learning more? Head over to YouTube and search for "David Langer." My YouTube channel is the first search result you get.Oh, I also have many tutorials on how to conduct data analysis using Excel on my channel if that would be helpful.Ready to have more impact at work in 2022 using data?You've got this if you want it.Stay healthy and happy data sleuthing!#predictiveanalytics #analytics #businessanalytics #dataanalytics #dataanalysis	2022-02-19 10:35:19-05	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQFzqmOciJmv7w/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1645280118073?e=1648080000&v=beta&t=vQAHHeu1UVYSpCm9xhHxCahCp5ufExhTK9mCKfDfWVM	Image

Join me next week for a live meetup on how ANY professional can use Excel to have more impact at work using data.Here's the abstract:"Organisations have made big bets on the power of data to drive business results. From data warehouses, to data lakes, to self-service BI, large of amounts of money have been spent on infrastructures to enable data-driven decisions.There is just one problem.Data infrastructure alone is not enough. You need data literate professionals to analyze and use the data to realize the ROI of data infrastructure investments. Not surprisingly, data literacy is top of mind for many organizations in 2022.In this talk, you will learn how easy it is to acquire hands-on skills with data to perform sophisticated analyses and make truly data-driven decisions."Learn more and register here: https://lnkd.in/g87r9CQAHope to see you next week!#dataliteracy #excel #analytics #businessanalytics #microsoftexcel	2022-02-16 20:27:46-05	https://www.meetup.com/London-Excel-Meetup-Group/events/283306684/	Article
98	3	6	Have you wondered what happens under the hood when you pay with USD and the seller from Europe receives EUR (euro)? This process is called foreign exchange..Suppose Bob (the buyer) needs to pay 100 USD to Alice (the seller), and Alice can only receive EUR. The diagram below illustrates the process.1. Bob sends 100 USD via a third-party payment provider. In our example, it is Paypal. The money is transferred from Bobs bank account (Bank B) to Paypals account in Bank P1.2. Paypal needs to convert USD to EUR. It leverages the foreign exchange provider (Bank E). Paypal sends 100 USD to its USD account in Bank E.3. 100 USD is sold to Bank Es funding pool.4. Bank Es funding pool provides 88 EUR in exchange for 100 USD. The money is put into Paypals EUR account in Bank E.5. Paypals EUR account in Bank P2 receives 88 EUR.6. 88 EUR is paid to Alices EUR account in Bank A.Now lets take a close look at the foreign exchange (forex) market. It has 3 layers: Retail market. Funding pools are parts of the retail market. To improve efficiency, Paypal usually buys a certain amount of foreign currencies in advance. Wholesale market. The wholesale business is composed of investment banks, commercial banks, and foreign exchange providers. It usually handles accumulated orders from the retail market. Top-level participants. They are multinational commercial banks that hold lots of money from different countries. When Bank Es funding pool needs more EUR, it goes upward to the wholesale market to sell USD and buy EUR. When the wholesale market accumulates enough orders, it goes upward to top-level participants. Steps 3.1-3.3 and 4.1-4.3 explain how it works.If you have any questions, please leave a comment.What foreign currency did you find difficult to exchange? And what company have you used for foreign currency exchange?Please follow me if you want to receive weekly updates about tech interviews, system design, or book writing.

230	2	3	I was asked again yesterday why I have so much Microsoft Excel content, but no content on Power BI. I've used Power BI in the past and found it to be a powerful tool. That being said, Excel is the key for spreading data literacy far and wide.At the heart of data literacy is the idea that the vast majority of data analyses can, and should, be conducted by business professionals - not Data Analysts/Scientists. As a hands-on analytics practitioner, I 100% subscribe to this.With an estimated 700+ million users worldwide, Microsoft Excel is the data tool of choice for all manner of business professionals. Put another way, Excel is the lingua franca of data literacy.This is why I teach professionals how to do the following with Excel: Visually analyze data KPI analysis Logistic regression Linear regression Data storytellingAll of the above serve Excel users very well for achieving data literacy and will also serve any professional if they move beyond Excel to tools like Power BI, R, and SQL.Notice I wrote "...if they move beyond Excel..."With the right skills/techniques, Microsoft Excel can be all the data literacy tooling needed by many business professionals.   True data literacy for ANY professional with Microsoft Excel.You've got this if you want it.Stay healthy and happy data sleuthing!#dataliteracy #excel #analytics #businessanalytics #businessintelligence	2022-02-26 10:04:53-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc
101	6	3	Data science, data engineering and ML are all about building data solutions. But by focusing on elegance and perfection, we often forget to address the actual problem. 5 suggestions to stay focused:1. Define the MVS (minimum viable solution) for the problem. Write it down. Attach is to to calendar invites and documents for everyone to see. Remind everyone of the problem.2. Check in. Presumably, you are solving a problem for a stakeholder or customer. Do a weekly check in to see if you're tracking toward the right solution. They are a great check on your level of focus.3. Define nice-to-have vs must-have. A solution often ends up with lots of requirements because everyone wants to do their best. That's great - but it doesn't mean its necessary. Be clear about what is nice to have.4. Set a tough deadline for MVS. Compressed deadlines often require us to drop the unnecessary from a solution. We can then iterate on enhancing the solution.5. Don't assume sprints are the right approach. Thinking in terms of sprints can be useful, but it can also slow down progress and make teams think in chunks of time that don't make sense.How do you stay focused? #datascience #dataengineering #analytics #machinelearning	2022-02-16 20:27:46-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

103	9	2	How can Kubernetes help Data Scientists & Data Engineers for building large-scale Data Products?- A Data Scientist can simply deploy the application without worrying about scaling, replication, availability, etc because Kubernetes does that automatically. - Kubernetes 'retry' running the failed application & this makes life much easier. Ensuring high availability with low cost is really easy with K8s.- Kubernetes ecosystem has one of the most mature observability systems, so finding the exact issue quickly if any application fails is much easier. This is one of the founding requirement for data engineering applications.- Kubernetes provides an entire isolated environment to Data Scientists for testing & experimenting with anything but strict governance. A Data scientist can ignore all security, login policy, etc & can focus on work!- K8s provides API for dependency on other applications before launching, this makes many data application deployments extremely easy.- With Hybrid Cloud, k8s is only about switching context. So If a Data Scientist or engineer working/sharing over multiple clouds, the setup is almost non-existent.- K8s is declarative & currently every expected feature has some open source or managed service available. This is bringing amazing features/applications around K8s ecosystem which helps large scale data applications.	2022-02-16 20:27:46-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

108	10	3	Even puppies know how important learning data science is. Chelsea Parlett-Pelleriti is cracking me up with this photo of (I assume) her puppy reading Elements of Statistical Learning aka the machine learning Bible. ESL was so influential in my life. Seriously. In fact here are 4 more books I wish people knew about when they are getting into data science. 1. Introduction to Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani, & Friedman )- ISL is Best for learning algorithms like Random Forest & PCA, and actually understanding it. ISL is the primer for ESL. 2. Applied Predictive Modeling (Kuhn, Johnson) - this is one of my all time favorites. Best for learning how to apply machine learning algorithms. Uses the older caret framework but can easily be done using tidymodels now. 3. Tidymodels with R Book (Kuhn, Silge) - this is the next progression in machine learning that takes APM to tidymodels. 4. Feature Engineering & Selection (Kuhn, Johnson) - Finally a book on the most important part of machine learning, making predictive features. Every Kaggle competition winners owe credit to feature engineering, so why are you spending all your time on algorithms (and none on making good features)?Ok, so the next challenge you are going to run into is, How do I apply machine learning to my job?How do I know this? Its because I was trying to answer that same question AND IT TOOK ME 5-YEARS!!!Way too long, right?Well the good news is that Ive made a free 40-minute webinar that literally condenses 5-years of knowledge into 40 value-packed minutes. And if you are even remotely considering becoming a data scientist, then its a no brainer - watch my webinar.  You will get 10 secrets that would have saved me countless hours (and shaved years off my journey where half the time I was lost). Alright, I hope this helps a few of you. Good luck. Your friendly neighborhood data scientist,MattP.S. All links to Machine Learning books are in the comments below. P.P.S.

All file operations have strong copy-on-write guarantees and if power is lost the filesystem will fall back to the last known good state.- Dynamic wear leveling- littlefs is designed with flash in mind, and provides wear leveling over dynamic blocks. Additionally, littlefs can detect bad blocks and work around them.- Bounded RAM/ROM- littlefs is designed to work with a small amount of memory. RAM usage is strictly bounded, which means RAM consumption does not change as the filesystem grows. The filesystem contains no unbounded recursion and dynamic memory is limited to configurable buffers that can be provided statically.

141	9	2	Are we leveraging RDMA (Random Direct Memory Access) for building modern Data Engineering Applications?RDMA is a system where a network card is capable of moving data from memory to storage with using minimal CPU or no CPU at all. This obviously brings high throughput & low Latency!- RDMA as well ignores kernel &  transfers data directly from user virtual memory on one node to use virtual memory on another node! And yeah no blocking!So we have a pattern where all Data Engineering or distributed storage data movement can be no CPU & can expect a wildly fast transfer, but are we leveraging that?One problem is cache coherence which doesn't seem like a big problem, another is small DMA operations which eventually hurt CPU performance but Defragmentation may help.	2022-02-19 08:20:21-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

Never underestimate the power of Excel!Make no mistake, tools like logistic regression are not the sole purview of Data Analysts and Data Scientists. Logistic regression is useful for ANY professional.[HR] - What factors are highly predictive of high performers?[Product Management] - What feature usage(s) are highly predictive of a sticky customer?[Customer Service] - What are the factors under customer services control associated with CSAT?[Marketing] - What are the demographic factors that predict conversion?The list goes on.What many professionals don't know is the process for learning predictive analytics techniques is basically the same whether you use Excel, R, or Python.For example, once you learn the concepts behind logistic regression they are equally applicable between Excel and R.This allows professionals to start with Microsoft Excel and the easily move to R if the need arises (e.g., working with millions of rows of data).Want to have more impact at work with data in 2022?Never underestimate what your Excel skills make possible.Stay healthy and happy data sleuthing!BTW - This post has given me a crazy idea.

150	7	5	Skip is an open-source programming language with lots of interesting features. Could it be the basis of a new breed of deep learning frameworks?- safe parallelism- strongly typed with type inference.- simple syntax- functional, but can also be object oriented- variables are unmutable by default- garbage collector is predictable- things that can be pre-computed and cached are.- Lisp like: closures, sequences of instructions return the last valueNow, people just want to use Python at the top level. This is unlikely to change any time soon. But for lower-level programming (and the high level for the purists), some numerically-oriented, GPU-supporting version of Skip may make sense, no?Skip was originally developed at Facebook by a team led by Julien Verlaguet. Julien left FB to build products around Skip (like this one: https://sqlive.io/ )in fact, Julien implemented an experimental deep learning framework in Skip, based on the ArrayFire tensor engine, and inspired by FlashLight: https://lnkd.in/d7khTm2Jhttp://skiplang.com/ #deeplearning #programming #skiplang #lisp 	2022-02-19 08:35:17-05	http://skiplang.com/	Article

232	3	6	You probably heard about . What is SWIFT? What role does it play in cross-border payments? You can find answers to those questions in this post.The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is the main secure   that links the worlds banks.The Belgium-based system is run by its member banks and handles millions of payment messages per day. The diagram below illustrates how payment messages are transmitted from Bank A (in New York) to Bank B (in London).Step 1: Bank A sends a message with transfer details to Regional Processor A in New York. The destination is Bank B.Step 2: Regional processor validates the format and sends it to Slice Processor A. The Regional Processor is responsible for input message validation and output message queuing. The Slice Processor is responsible for storing and routing messages safely.Step 3: Slice Processor A stores the message.Step 4: Slice Processor A informs Regional Processor A the message is stored.Step 5: Regional Processor A sends ACK/NAK to Bank A. ACK means a message will be sent to Bank B. NAK means the message will NOT be sent to Bank B.Step 6: Slice Processor A sends the message to Regional Processor B in London.Step 7: Regional Processor B stores the message temporarily.Step 8: Regional Processor B assigns a unique ID MON (Message Output Number) to the message and sends it to Slice Processor BStep 9: Slice Processor B validates MON.Step 10: Slice Processor B authorizes Regional Processor B to send the message to Bank B.Step 11: Regional Processor B sends the message to Bank B.Step 12: Bank B receives the message and stores it.Step 13: Bank B sends UAK/UNK to Regional Processor B. UAK (user positive acknowledgment) means Bank B received the message without error; UNK (user negative acknowledgment) means Bank B received checksum failure.Step 14: Regional Processor B creates a report based on Bank Bs response, and sends it to Slice Processor B.Step 15: Slice Processor B stores the report.Step 16 - 17: Slice Processor B sends a copy of the report to Slice Processor A. Slice Processor A stores the report.Please follow me if you want to receive weekly updates about tech interviews, system design, or book writing.

To help build these skills, I have a real-world project predictive analytics project available on my YouTube channel.With all the hype around machine learning and AI, it is easy to forget that predictive analytics can also be used to gain insights into the "why" of what's going on in the business:[HR] - What are the important factors that predict promotion velocity?[Product Management] - What feature usage(s) are highly predictive of a sticky SaaS customer?[Marketing] - Which factors have the most impact on customer lifetime value (CLV)?[Customer Service] - Can we handle more calls with a different mix of agents?[Supply Chain] - What are the factors that predict customer returns?The project below is based on my hands-on analytics work at a previous employer. The project has all the things: Freely available data from US government agencies. Data in different formats that need to be cleaned, transformed, and merged. A very specific business question to be answered via predictive analytics. You can use tools like Excel, SQL, R, Python, etc. to work on the project. Can be a great addition to a project portfolio.Interested in learning more? Head over to YouTube and search for "David Langer."

233	3	6	In modern architecture, systems are broken up into small and independent building blocks with well-defined interfaces between them. Message queues provide communication and coordination for those building blocks. Today, lets discuss different delivery semantics: at-most once, at-least once, and exactly once.- As the name suggests, at-most once means a message will be delivered not more than once. Messages may be lost but are not redelivered. This is how at-most once delivery works at the high level.Use cases: It is suitable for use cases like monitoring metrics, where a small amount of data loss is acceptable.- With this data delivery semantic, its acceptable to deliver a message more than once, but no message should be lost.Use cases: With at-least once, messages wont be lost but the same message might be delivered multiple times. While not ideal from a user perspective, at-least once delivery semantics are usually good enough for use cases where data duplication is not a big issue or deduplication is possible on the consumer side. For example, with a unique key in each message, a message can be rejected when writing duplicate data to the database. Exactly once is the most difficult delivery semantic to implement. It is friendly to users, but it has a high cost for the systems performance and complexity.Use cases: Financial-related use cases (payment, trading, accounting, etc.). Exactly once is especially important when duplication is not acceptable and the downstream service or third party doesnt support idempotency.Question: what is the difference between message queues vs event streaming platforms such as Kafka, Apache Pulsar, etc?Please follow me if you want to receive weekly updates about tech interviews, system design, or book writing.

260	8	1	Data storytellingis an art, it's the ability to effectively communicate insights from a dataset using narratives and visualizations. It can be used to put data insights into context for and inspire action from your audience.There are three key components to data storytelling:Data:Thorough analysis of accurate, complete data serves as the foundation of your data story. Analyzing data using descriptive,diagnostic,predictive, andprescriptiveanalysis can enable you to understand its full picture.Narrative:A verbal or written narrative, also called a storyline, is used to communicate insights gleaned from data, the context surrounding it, and actions you recommend and aim to inspire in your audience.Visualizations:Visual representationsof your data and narrative can be useful for communicating its story clearly and memorably. These can be charts, graphs, diagrams, pictures, or videos.Credit: 100people org#datastorytelling#datavisualization#datascience	2022-02-27 08:34:40-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc
183	3	6	A content delivery network (CDN) refers to geographically distributed servers (also called edge servers) that provide fast delivery of static and dynamic content. Lets take a look at how it works..Suppose Bob who lives in New York wants to visit an eCommerce website that is deployed in London. If the request goes to servers located in London, the response will be quite slow. So we deploy CDN servers close to where Bob lives, and the content will be loaded from the nearby CDN server.The diagram below illustrates the process:1. Bob types in www.myshop.com in the browser. The browser looks up the domain name in the local DNS cache.2. If the domain name does not exist in the local DNS cache, the browser goes to the DNS resolver to resolve the name. The DNS resolver usually sits in the Internet Service Provider (ISP).3. The DNS resolver recursively resolves the domain name (see my previous post for details). Finally, it asks the authoritative name server to resolve the domain name.4. If we dont use CDN, the authoritative name server returns the IP address for www.myshop.com. But with CDN, the authoritative name server has an alias pointing to www.myshop.cdn.com (the domain name of the CDN server).5. The DNS resolver asks the authoritative name server to resolve www.myshop.cdn.com.6. The authoritative name server returns the domain name for the load balancer of CDN www.myshop.lb.com.7. The DNS resolver asks the CDN load balancer to resolve www.myshop.lb.com. The load balancer chooses an optimal CDN edge server based on the users IP address, users ISP, the content requested, and the server load.8. The CDN load balancer returns the CDN edge servers IP address for www.myshop.lb.com.9. Now we finally get the actual IP address to visit. The DNS resolver returns the IP address to the browser.10. The browser visits the CDN edge server to load the content. There are two types of contents cached on the CDN servers: static contents and dynamic contents. The former contains static pages, pictures, videos; the latter one includes results of edge computing.11. If the edge CDN server cache doesn't contain the content, it goes upward to the regional CDN server. If the content is still not found, it will go upward to the central CDN server, or even go to the origin - the London web server. This is called the CDN distribution network, where the servers are deployed geographically.   : How to prevent videos cached on CDN from being pirated?Please follow me if you want to receive weekly updates about tech interviews, system design, or book writing.

You have to blast out A LOT of applications to get seen. - networking with recruiters on LinkedIn is a smarter, more targeted strategy for finding a job! - getting to 500 connections on LinkedIn gives you more credibility - building a cool portfolio website with Wix or Squarespace puts you a step above the competition - remember that internships and volunteering count as REAL experience! - publish some dashboards to Tableau Public to really show off your visualization skills! #linkedin #datascience #dataanalytics #coffeewalkswithzach	2022-03-03 23:35:07-05	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQHzJcNl2TzzsQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1646245096879?e=1649289600&v=beta&t=sR0WpKO4iYKkShAH2FebVmRGFFkQQ-2H0IoqV4Fi92s	Image

290	10	3	I love errors. Here's why. When I started learning data science, I was just like everyone else. I only saw errors. AND, they made me insanely frustrated. But, over time I learned to love errors. Wait, what?! Someone can love errors?!?! Bull %$*!I'm serious - I learn 100X more from errors than I do from writing pristine code.And, so I can tell you that when my student sent me this error, that I was 1000% supportive. He said things like, "I feel dumb." and "I regret sending this to you".I told him, "don't feel dumb." This is 1000% what you should have done. Because now you know how to solve the error.And, the next time this happens, you're now prepared. THIS is why errors are so valuable. Like hidden gifts. Because when you solve them, you learn 100X more than before. Now, you might be thinking there's no way I'm going to ever learn data science this way. You're wrong. And I know because I thought the SAME THING. BUT, what got me through was Google, StackOverflow, and now I'm able to help my students get through these errors too. So YOU CAN DO IT. And, if you are looking for help in becoming a data scientis, I'd love to help. I have a free gift. A 40-minute webinar on how to become a data scientist. The webinar captures the 10 data science skills that proved to be most valuable in my career. And, the webinar will shave years off of learning data science the hard way. Alright, good luck. Let's crush data science. -MattPS - I'll leave a link to my free 40-minute webinar in the comments below. Check it out. It's the most value you'll get out of 40-minutes this week.

286	6	3	Data is a community! Decisions are only as good as the data engineers, data management experts and database developers enable them to be. Companies cannot be at their best without them: 5 examples:1. Data engineers make life better and easier. Ever worked with bad data pipelines? Ever wondered "where's my data at?" If you haven't, you have awesome data engineers around you.2. Database developers make sure we can get to the data when we need it. Ever run a query that times out when you have a presentation in 20 minutes? If you haven't, you have awesome database developers around you.3. Data management somehow slips under the radar. But if you've never had to worry about creating master records or matching and merging updates, you've got an amazing data management team around you.4. Data modelers are incredible. If you've always had an easy time joining datasets together, and not wondered who on earth forgot to make a primary key, you have good data modelers around you.5. If you're hiring a data science team, you won't see the results you want unless these capabilities are present. Period.

209	2	3	Warning - this post isn't my typical content. I read a lot and rarely does a book resonate with me on both a personal and professional level. Ben Jones's latest work is one of those rare reads."The Introspective Entrepreneur" isn't your typical business book. The pages take the form of Ben's journal that documents his journey as an entrepreneur.I saw myself in these pages. Like Ben, when I started Dave on Data: I was, and remain, a business of one. I bootstrapped my business with personal savings. I was fortunate that my partner put me on her employer-provided health insurance.There are many more examples of how Ben's journey mirrors my own. I would bet that other solopreneurs would have a similar experience reading the book.If you are contemplating starting a solopreneur business do yourself a favor and get a copy of the "The Introspective Entrepreneur."Stay healthy and happy data sleuthing!#entrepreneur #entrepreneurship #solopreneur #solopreneurs	2022-02-23 22:05:22-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

235	5	4	On this day back in 2009, I was accepted to NUAMES (i.e. Northern Utah Academy of Math, Engineering and Science), an early-college charter high school in Layton, Utah. My sophomore year was a college/high school hybrid. My junior and senior years were full-time college at Weber State University. I took full-time credits every semester junior and senior year including summer semester. I graduated high school with 3 years of college done. Instead of graduating with my applied math degree a year after high school graduation, I opted to get a dual major in applied math and computer science and graduated a year later. Thank you so much NUAMES and Weber State University! Y'all are the true MVPs who laid the foundation of my success!	2022-02-26 10:04:53-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

236	5	4	A really great double Husky walk today with Akhil! We talked a lot about what separates a BI engineer from a data engineer. Some key differences:  Data engineers (DEs) are usually more technical working with things like Spark and Python much more. DEs should know a lot about data modeling and how to construct usable data sets.  DEs should have business acumen to know when to push back on low-value business requests. BI engineers focus more on visualization and story telling than DEs do. Thanks so much for walking with me today Akhil! #coffeewalkswithzach#dataengineering	2022-02-26 10:04:53-05	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQGFHu6NDHwSsg/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1645816436623?e=1648684800&v=beta&t=wsNIEExvlJZZ0-fRZBj1M8yUedSQPcCiudnI5TsoE7I	Image
184	5	4	Having low self-esteem can be dangerous for your career and your #mentalhealth. Earlier in my career, I didnt feel good about myself. I felt I had to EARN my seat at the table by outworking and out-hustling everyone around me. I kept saying yes until I reached a breaking point and Id start getting panic attacks and insomnia. I kept feeling the need to nurse that low self-esteem with career results because they were indisputable markers that I had worth. This was a huge thinking error that held me back from so much growth. My worth is INHERENT. Im worthy and good enough regardless of how many lines of code I write!

We talked about how in early startups dedicated data people are often hired later and its up to the product manager and software engineers to manage the data infrastructure early on. Theres kind of a natural evolution of analytics for a startup. Google analytics then relational database then data lake.  We talked about the importance of AB testing your startups landing page to really understand what is making people stay and actually have interest in your product.

187	5	4	Ive been coding a REST API in Rust recently and Ive been loving it. My old go-to tools for REST APIs usually is NodeJS. But going forward itll be Rust.  Heres what I really like about Rust so far: 1. True compile-time checks. Rust wont let you code terribly. You cant sneak in a @ts-ignore like you can in TypeScript. 2. Rust is blazing fast and multithreaded.3. Rust has a really great package manager called cargo that is very nice to work with and seems more functional than npm in some ways.  4. Besides C, Rust is the most environmentally-friendly language. 4 times better than JavaScript.  #softwareengineering	2022-02-22 22:05:44-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

They seem like another collectible like Pokmon cards. Id bet on a physical Pokmon card before Id bet on an NFT. What is the long-term value? The things I think that will stay around and build tons of value smart contracts, block chain transparency, metaverses and decentralization. We talked about the new Web3 domains like .ETH, .X, and .CRYPTO. I really need to get one of these domains to be a cool kid!

189	6	3	The get things done mentality is a must - here's why:1. The data space has no shortage of brilliant people. What is harder to find are those people who are truly able to operate within an organization to get things done. Working with and influencing people is hard stuff.2. Most of the hard organizational problems aren't purely about data science or machine learning. They are about organizing people and teams around problems that unlock value for the business. That takes persistence, patience and more than technical skill.3. Building data products is hard because it isn't just about the building, it is about being a product evangelist and motivating people to behave in new ways around data. Creativity is key here.4. In a new space like data product (at least for most companies), there is a lot of ambiguity in the role and outcome. Ambiguity won't go away quickly and someone's ability to work within it is critical to success.5. This point is probably more selfish, but I get a lot of energy out of working with those who are unafraid and excited by a tough path forward, full of challenges in user adoption and supporting organizational growth.#data#datascience#dataproduct#analytics#machinelearning	2022-02-22 22:05:45-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

241	6	3	The job market is hot. But you still need to show up well in the interview. One way to do that is to showcase your previous work/projects. 5 ideas to ensure your projects shine in your resume:1. Context and problem definition: So many projects jump straight to the technical solution. Slow down.What problem are you solving and why? Lots of thought is needed here!2. Define metrics and key outcomes measures useful to the situation. Good metrics are hard to develop. You must articulate why yours make sense.3. Evaluate data quality. This should show up mostly in full project descriptions. You wont get to skip this in a job, make this an important step in your work.4. Create useful and unique features that go beyond the available features if possible. More senior roles require good performance here.5. Define actions for the business. Pretend you are submitting this to a business user. Make it actionable, dont just summarize.Notice I didnt talk about modeling? Or a specific language?

Defining SQL subqueries in the appropriate cases.6. Checking the assumptions of linear models.7. Understanding how to take a simple random sample.8. Explaining confidence and/or credible intervals.9. Ability to say in 5 minutes what you could say in 30 min.10. Never thinking you've got it all down.

243	6	3	Its about people. Really, it is. 5 things I learned from "Restoring the Soul of Business: Staying Human in the Age of Data" (a great read):1. Company's true competitive advantage is people, not tech. Tech eventually becomes a commodity, but people provide the real differentiator. This has never been more true than in the talent fight we have right now.2. Quants often get so caught up in spreadsheets, they forget to talk about the story of the business and why people want to be a part of it. If people aren't inspired by what they are a part of, the clock is ticking on when they'll leave.3. A compelling story is critical for a business to grow like it wants to, because people connect to stories and to people. Ask those around you - what are story are you a part of? You'll get some interesting answers.4. Our calendars don't work for us, we work for our calendars. The sheer number of recurring meetings that don't provide benefit or make impact are huge, but we go along with our calendars because they are full.5.

207	8	1	Awesome visualization, comparison of the rotational speed of the planets in the solar system and their axis of rotation in real-time!Visualization is one of the most effective and beautiful ways of Data storytelling. The concept of using pictures to understand data has been around for centuries, from maps and graphs in the 17th century to the invention of the pie chart in the early 1800s. Several decades later, one of the most cited examples of statistical graphics occurred when Charles Minard mapped Napoleons invasion of Russia.Find the latest AI and Tech News here:https://lnkd.in/gXdnMMWN#datascience#visualization #storytelling #tech	2022-02-23 22:05:22-05	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQEylp7uBZIkGg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1645602231852?e=1648684800&v=beta&t=20edF5Z1qnpAdt_KerXQXlf-OBuMRmrBXeLBko4o1Uw	Image
210	3	6	In many large-scale applications, data is divided into partitions that can be accessed separately. There are two typical strategies for partitioning data. Vertical partitioning: it means some columns are moved to new tables. Each table contains the same number of rows but fewer columns (see diagram below). Horizontal partitioning (often called sharding): it divides a table into multiple smaller tables. Each table is a separate data store, and it contains the same number of columns, but fewer rows (see diagram below).Horizontal partitioning is widely used so lets take a closer look. The routing algorithm decides which partition (shard) stores the data. Range-based sharding. This algorithm uses ordered columns, such as integers, longs, timestamps, to separate the rows. For example, the diagram below uses the User ID column for range partition: User IDs 1 and 2 are in shard 1, User IDs 3 and 4 are in shard 2. Hash-based sharding. This algorithm applies a hash function to one column or several columns to decide which row goes to which table. For example, the diagram below uses    2 as a hash function. User IDs 1 and 3 are in shard 1, User IDs 2 and 4 are in shard 2. Facilitate horizontal scaling. Sharding facilitates the possibility of adding more machines to spread out the load. Shorten response time. By sharding one table into multiple tables, queries go over fewer rows, and results are returned much more quickly. The order by operation is more complicated. Usually, we need to fetch data from different shards and sort the data in the application's code. Uneven distribution. Some shards may contain more data than others (this is also called the hotspot).This topic is very big and Im sure I missed a lot of important details. What else do you think is important for data partitioning?Please follow me if you want to receive weekly updates about tech interviews, system design, or book writing.

213	5	4	Had a really great walk with Joo today! We talked a lot about #datascience interviews. Follow #coffeewalkswithzach to not miss these posts! Data science interviews are often broken into a few pieces: - SQL The SQL interviews really test things like window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER, and rolling SUMs). They also may include things like self-joins. - Coding / PythonSome data science interviews may give you a leetcode question. Although it should be substantially easier than a #softwareengineering interview. - Product sense This interview tests your knowledge of metrics and measuring a products success. Knowing how to answer questions like: What metrics would you create to measure this products success? is critical in these interviews. - Behavioral This interview tests how well you work with others. How do you give feedback? How do you receive it? Thanks so much for walking with me today Joo!

246	9	2	Basics of OpenTelemetry: Telemetry is the high-level term, which is the automated communication process from multiple data sources. It holds set data to monitor applications.Three of the most common types of telemetry are metrics, logs, and traces.- Metrics holds time series data in a particular frequency, useful for detecting a change in behavior.- Logs are usually structured data containing time-stamped events- Traces is designed for monitoring applications. It has the capability for a tracing solution to track and observe service requests as they flow through distributed systems by collecting data as the requests go from one service to another.* Observability is about the process of deriving value from telemetry.* OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools, APIs & SDKs. The core objective is to decouple the telemetry data from the tools of analyzing the same.OpenTelemetry tools can be used to instrument, generate, collect & export telemetry data for analysis!- Provides vendor-agnostic instrumentation library & Open-standard semantic conventions to ensure vendor-agnostic data collection- A single collector binary that can be deployed in a variety of ways including as an agent or gateway- It provides a means of generating telemetry and a pipeline for routing and processing it as well.

247	9	2	Building an infrastructure to support A/B Testing Machine Learning Model is a hard problem. - A/B testing is just not about tools & technologies but the ML Infrastructure must register important business-specific KPIs to measure  & this needs input from business people. - Time required for A/B testing varies from business to business. If an A/B test needs beyond reasonable time to really justify the model performance, the ML infrastructure must ensure not drive any new model on the existing running A/B test(s).- The ML Infrastructure should support multiple A/B tests. - There must be real-time feedback of running the A/B Test & the infrastructure must support reconciliation to the last checkpoint model if a particular A/B test crosses any significant threshold.- Some A/B tests require a specific section of the traffic, which brings additional complexities to the infrastructure. Do you have any feedback/learnings on the Machine Learning A/B test?	2022-02-26 10:04:54-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc
248	9	2	SSD Storage - Scale Caching without increasing too much cost & Smart Indexing for faster data query.There are many technologies that use SSDs for building the caching layer by replacing RAM because SSDs are much cheaper.Technologies are as well using smart indexing over SSDs to make the data query way faster. If you can index all the relevant data to SSD by learning user query patterns, then there will be no cache miss over SSDs. Moreover, SSDs are non-volatile, so all the indexes are always stored and never needed to regenerate due to power failure.I learned that Varada is using similar technology to provide extremely fast results from databases, technically it is avoiding many expensive database calls responding to the result back from SSD.SSDs can hold many tiny data segments based on user query patterns, and act like a random access file system. So a query can use metadata to reach the exact SSD segments (data block) & there is no need to hit the database!

251	10	3	This used to be me when I was first learning linear regression. But here's what changed for me. I always thought it was funny how in the stats books, they'd always tell you of this magical P-Value level of 0.05. You either accept or reject. If p>0.05, that feature gets axed cold turkey. Ignored. That feature was dead to me...So naturally I'd do whatever I could to get my p-values under 0.05.So what changed?I started learning machine learning and actually seeing that my model performance would improve with features that had p-values greater than 0.05.Wait, what?!This magical p-value was actually costing me good information?!!!Yup. So fast-forward to today. I still use Linear Regression... ...But, to more accurate forecasts and churn models, I began using new algorithms like XGBoost & H2O. And what's cool is these algorithms will help you. These algorithms penalize bad features so we don't have to drop them cold-turkey style like with Linear Regression. You just have to know how to use these algorithms.Anyways, I guess what I'm saying is... It took me painfully long to learn secrets like this. Like 5-years.And, I don't want you to have to take EONS to learn too. In fact, I'd like to help you. I put together a free webinar - It's 40-minutes of training on the 10 secrets that took my 5-years to learn in my path to becoming a data scientist.

291	5	4	I had a really special walk today with Vini! Vini is a developer advocate for Databricks, one of my favorite companies! She gave me a tour of the Databricks office! We talked about some of the big pain points of data engineers. Data discoverability is a huge hurdle. Data engineers do great work but often the data they produce isn't utilized as much as it could be because other people in the company aren't as aware that it exists! Data lineage is another huge hurdle. Without a solid data lineage option, deprecating data sets and understanding data flow is impossible! We also talked a bit about web3 and crypto and how it intersects with #dataengineering. The fact that all transactions are available in a blockchain and you can get that data is a massive opportunity for data engineers in the web3 space!

307	6	3	Your scope and impact aren't in your job description - they are in your decisions about how to tell your story and where to invest your time. Here's what matters most:1. Your belief in what you want to be, or pursuit in figuring that out. Seriously. You get to define yourself and your work. If you want it, you'll make what needs to happen, happen.2. Always be learning. Every complex job requires continuous learning. I care less about where you do the learning, more than you are actively doing it.3. Bias toward action. What makes you "real" is continuously pushing the boundary of what is possible. Don't sit back and wait for others to define what you should do. You get to do that.4. Tuning out the noise. There is so much advice and so much negativity. Just tune it out. Make decisions that make you feel excited and valued every day.5. Have fun. Sound weird? We are in this field because it is fun. If you lose that spark, everything feels 100x harder. Keep the joy :)Don't wait for someone else to justify your work for you.

308	6	3	There are so many hot "data trends that promise to be the next big thing. Don't pursue a topic just because its on a top list. Focus on what *you* need - not what others say you do. Here are 5 ideas how:1. Start with what interests you. There's no replacement for something that makes you say "I can't wait to sit down and learn this." Truly, it doesn't matter if anyone says its the right thing - it is *your* thing.2. Try some things out but don't fully dive in unless you want to. If you've seen "10 courses to make you an expert", you might feel like you need to do all 10. You don't. Pick 1 to see if you're interested!3. Pick things that are relevant to you. If you work in an analytics environment, you don't need to be a deep learning practitioner (unless you want to). Focus on the things that add value for *you*.4. There's a lot of advice out there. Most of it might not apply to you. When you read advice, think about how it fits with your experience and if you can make use of it. If not, just move onto the next.5. If you're really overwhelmed, focus on 1-2 people you really trust. Tune out the noise beyond those people. Deep dive and engage with them and their advice.Your world is pretty full of noise - it is okay to say "stop" and find the things that truly matter to you.#data#datascience#analytics#machinelearning	2022-03-03 23:35:07-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

Want a practical approach to building your data literacy?Developing a data literate workforce is top of mind for leaders. Why? Using data to drive the business leads to better outcomes.In the future, employers will expect a certain level of data literacy. Just as employers expect skills in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint today.Analytics is changing all aspects of business. Data literate professionals in HR, Customer Service, Marketing, Product Mgmt, etc. will differentiate themselves. Imagine you a Customer Service Manager (CSM) that could answer questions like the following using data: Do median call lengths vary by geography? By product line? Other factors? Is the 2nd shift truly more efficient at handling calls? What are the factors that predict a call being escalated to a lead? What are the critical factors that impact staffing levels?Do you think this CSM would be valued by their employer?One of my most popular talks provides a practical hands-on approach to build the skills needed to answer questions like the above.

262	6	3	Perfect data produces dont make perfect decisions. Nor do people. Its about dealing with the imperfect: 1. You could have the perfect dashboard. The dashboard doesn't immediately result in action. That requires a decision, a series of actions and movement. Those aren't easily put into a product.2. You can run an ideal experiment. That doesn't guarantee the right or safe decision. Habits are hard to break. Humans have various motivations. We have to design products with that in mind.3. You might have the "perfect" north star metric. But that doesn't mean everyone is going to follow it or think it is the right approach. Creating common action behind something requires more than a product.4. You might have a great product. But if no one knows it exists, is it really great? How people find your product is incredibly important, either internal or external customers.5. Not everything should be a product. There's a place for education, training and focusing on engaging in other ways.Building the next great data product isn't necessarily about the tech.

331	9	2	What is Log - Foundation behind Databases & Distributed SystemsThe log is an append-only series of immutable information over time. Logs are totally ordered.Logs are becoming the primary interface for passing information between multiple data systems. Logs are as well the single source of truth!Logs solve the ordering challenge in a #distributedsystem Core properties of DB Log- Logs keeps the records of database changes, which can be used to restore the #database to the last stable point.- Logs are persisted immediately- All changes to application data in the database are recorded serially in the database log.- Syncing of events over DB replicas is based on logging sequence. (ACID)Logging is tightly coupled with Distributed System Replication. There are 2 methods of replication1. Primary-Backup where the leader executes all operations & publishes the changes to other replicas for backup.2. State machine replication, if two state machines are fed the same input operations in the same order, their outputs will be the samePrimary-Backup- Nominate one server the primary, call the other the backup - Clients send all operations (get, put) to the current primary - The primary orders clients operations - Should be only one primary at a timeState machine replicationAny server is essentially a state machine ( Operations are deterministic)-  Need an op to be executed on all replicas or none at all. All-or-Nothing atomicity.

268	9	2	SSH (Secure Shell) is a widely used Network Protocol for Secure Data Transfer. SSH is used in many Data Engineering applications & Decentralized blockchain systems.SSH provides a set of standards & an associated network protocol that allows establishing a secure connection between a local and a remote computer.Provides encryption between 2 systems for communication, based on public-private key cryptography for authentication- SSH Breaks data into packets- Each SSH packet contains length holding the length of the packets in bytes, padding length is the length of random padding, payload containing actual data, which can be compressed & Message Authentication Code contains MAC ( if authenticated, MAC contains value else None)- Each message that is sent after the encryption is negotiated must contain a MAC so that the other party can verify the packet integrityWorking:- There is 2 kind of keys Public & Private generated by SSH. The public key can be freely shared with any party. It is associated with its paired key, but the private key cannot be derived from the public key. The private key is the only component capable of decrypting messages that were encrypted using the associated public key- Upon receiving a connection request, the server sends the client a set of supported encryption protocols. The server uses the public key as the authentication method. If there are matching protocols, the machines agree to use one to establish the connection.** Common SSH Data Encryptions types are Symmetric, Asymmetric & Hashing- Symmetric encryption generates a single key that is shared for (de)encryption- Asymmetric uses 2 different but mathematically related keys, public and private, to perform the encryption.- Hashing uses payload to create a unique hash and the hash is being sent together with the packet. Both systems validate the message based on the hash value.

The tool is only as good as the person and their understanding of the context around it. Context and domain matters - from data cleaning, to modeling to interpretation.2. Data insights must be actionable and interpretable. I dont care how you made it, if you build something that doesnt allow for decision or insight it missed the mark.3. We have to sell. Our ideas, our models and our conclusions. We have to make it obvious that what we did is connected to business. Don't assume this just is understood.4. The best tools in the world dont fix a bad problem definition (or lack of one). Knowing what problem to solve is a very context driven and business dependent decision.5. People are still the core of what we do. They have emotions and biases. No tool, data or technique can overcome that. We have to respect that and work around and with people!What's your best tip for keeping focused on delivering value?#data#machinelearning#datascience#analytics	2022-02-28 10:34:37-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

314	9	2	Basics of Blockchain - Distributed SystemBlockchain is a Database or a type of Distributed Ledger.A distributed ledger is a database that is consensually shared and synchronized across multiple sites, institutions, or geographies, accessible by multiple people. It allows transactions to have public "witnesses.All nodes in a blockchain get an identical copy of all the blocks and any change is reflected in all participant nodes"A distributed ledger can be described as a ledger of any transactions or contracts maintained in decentralized form across different locations and people."How?A Blockchain is made of blocks and these blocks create a chain. Each block contains  data, a hash of the data & previous hashHash is an identifier of the data which is extremely hard to guess and a minor change in data changes the entire hash. Fundamentally blockchain is based on cryptography.Change anything in the data can generate an entirely new hash code and that leads to corruption of downstream blockchain. There are many ways to hack the system and change all the downstream blocks as well and much of the work is happening around that.What is Decentralized:Everyone is allowed to be a part of the blockchain network, so technically there is no governing body. All participants are connected based on a P2P network and each participant holds an identical copy of the blockchain. Any addition of a new block is get published to all the participants and then based on a different consensus algorithm, a block is approved.So a block is only approved when there is more than 50% of the voting.	2022-03-03 23:35:07-05	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQFsggOA-4pAWg/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1646223980079?e=1649289600&v=beta&t=z8n7MMm0A--ZMZNWUyYhbxPgJTnsjDWLIIqgxNgoTDc	Image

Heres my story.When I was first starting out, I was trying to apply Deep Learning to solve business problems.YEAH I KNOW - Jumping right into Deep Learning. Rookie move.Well I was a ROOKIE! And TensorFlow sounded cool. ButOMG. I failed big time.I spent weeks making TensorFlow models that couldnt consistently outperform a basic linear regression.This cost me months of work!So what happened?I went backwards. Back to the basics.When I started applying BASIC stats - Within group analysis, correlations, proportions, and probabilities The lightbulb went on! And, that was the beginning of my transition into actually getting results from machine learning.Because when the stats showed promising results. Then machine learning actually worked.OK - I know what youre thinking. But Matt, how do I get results without costing me months of headache, tearing out my hair, and stressing about this data science learning process that never seems to progress forward.Im with ya.

285	2	3	There is an unhealthy obsession with tools in the analytics space. So much rancor around tech A vs tech B when, in so many scenarios, the tech matters not at all.

By the way, out of curiosity, which technology did you use for your analysis?"DS - "I used Microsoft Excel to conduct the analysis and create the visualizations."BE - "Oh, that's too bad. Since you didn't use one of the IT-preferred technologies of Python/Tableau/Alteryx/whatever we have to ignore your insights and take a pass on this opportunity."Yes, a contrived example, but I think it captures the behaviors/beliefs of many in the analytics space.When I discuss organizational data literacy programs with clients the conversation never starts with technology. Clients start the conversation with improving business outcomes, changing culture, and skills development.If we in analytics want to unleash the untapped power of data, we need to shift our focus to people, not technology.Skills like data visualization, data storytelling, and KPI analysis can be taught either in a technology-neutral way or with a lowest common denominator tool (i.e., Microsoft Excel). These skills are then easily transferred to another tool (e.g., Power BI) if needed.Does your organization have an unhealthy obsession with analytics tech?Stay healthy and happy data sleuthing!#dataliteracy #datastorytelling #analytics #businessanalytics #dataanalytics	2022-03-01 10:34:34-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

320	10	3	Something tells me this model is off. A post on outliers. Ben Bond-Lamberty shared this over on Twitter, and simply said dont do this.  I couldnt agree more. 3 things about modeling outliers Ive learned the hard way:1. Linear models are highly susceptible to outliers.Basic linear regression can become heavily influenced by outliers. Ive made this mistake many times. My solution- Try algorithms like Xgboost that are less influenced by outliers. 2. Dont just drop outliers. Heres my hack. I used to remove outliers to prevent linear models from getting seriously out of whack. But Ive changed. Heres a simple trick. Just flag the outliers. Create a column of zeroes and ones that identify the outliers. This can help a ton. Especially when combined with better algorithms like Xgboost. 3. Visualization immediately highlights problems. Always, always, always plot your errors. This where show you where your model is having issues. Then you can course correct. Try adding more flags. Try different algorithms. If youre trying to become a data scientist, then learning how to handle outliers, missing values, working with text, dates, numeric, and then visualization, modeling, and experimentation can be a tall order. Ive been there. It took me 5-years to feel confident in data science. It seemed like every step forward, I took 2 steps backward. I was in sea of books, MOOCs, courses, and nothing was working. And further, ever time I went online Id hear of a new tool that I had to learn.I eventually broke through. But it took so long. And I dont want that to happen to you. This is why Ive created a free 40-minute webinar that consolidates the 1000s of things I learned into the 10 most important skills I actually used. This webinar gives you a blueprint.

282	3	6	Almost all the computer and storage systems are deployed in data centers. What does a   look like? The diagram below illustrates a typical layered architecture of a data center. Note: this is a legacy architecture, but having a good understanding of it helps us understand how the DC architecture evolves over time. It contains 3 main components: the access layer, aggregation layer, and core layer. A data center contains many servers, and the servers are placed on racks. Servers are usually directly linked to the Top of Rack (TOR) switch. This kind of switch is usually placed on the top of the rack, as its name implies. When there are many racks, we need another type of switch to connect them. These switches need to provide high-bandwidth performance. They are called aggregation switches.The aggregation layer connects a lot of computing nodes together and forms a cluster. This is often called Point of Delivery (POD), or Available Zone (AZ). To ensure high availability, we need to support multiple AZs. Core switches are used to connect multiple AZs together. Core switches have even higher performance requirements.Question: do you know how storage devices are connected to the network in data centers?Please follow me if you want to receive weekly updates about tech interviews, system design, or book writing.

Do you think your lack of math/programming skills will hold you back?Its hard to avoid all the social media posts, magazine articles, or news clips trumpeting how machine learning (often referred to as AI) is permanently changing the way organizations operate  and changing the expectations of employers.While data has always been used in business, things have changed. Functions like Human Resources, Product Management, and Customer Service are embracing advanced analytics to drive better business outcomes.The simple fact is that machine learning is a valuable skill for ANY professional to have more impact at work with data. Imagine employees that can use data to answer questions like these:[HR] - What factors are highly predictive of high performers?[Product Management] - What feature usage(s) are highly predictive of a sticky customer?[Customer Service] - What are the factors customer services can influence associated with churn?Do you think these employees will be more effective, and prized, in the data-driven future?I specialize in educating professionals for the data-driven future of business  and I mean ANY professional. If you have Microsoft Excel skills, I can teach you to analyze your business data with machine learning.No math background? No problem.No coding background? No problem. Ive spent years perfecting my teaching methods to make advanced analytics accessible to all  but I dont expect you to take my word for it:"First, I'd like to thank Dave for the great effort he put on this course (Introduction to Machine Learning With R). For an introductory course, I found it very detailed and well explained. The methods he uses on teaching are just awesome and that makes the course way too easy to understand.Dave is also very responsive and that just adds to the awesomeness. I honestly can't wait to take more courses with him. Also, the things you learn in this course are highly applicable in real life, and he makes the math to be so easy.

300	2	3	I was recently asked on LinkedIn the following question - "Will the data science community ever agree on Microsoft Excel being awesome?" Not surprisingly, I get a lot of haters for my content, and this post will likely generate more .My response to this question - "It doesn't matter."To provide context, I am a technical person. I've been a software engineer and I do hands-on machine learning projects for my clients.So why do I spend so much time evangelizing using Microsoft Excel to analyze data? Don't I "know better" than to encourage this?My experiences have taught me that in the future employers will expect a certain level of data literacy just as they expect a certain level of skill with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint today.Many organizations have made investments in providing widespread access to data (e.g., Self-Service BI programs). For these investments to deliver their ROI, they need users that can effectively use the data.Using this data effectively requires more than reports and dashboards (i.e., Descriptive Analytics). Using this data effectively requires data analysis skills.As much as technical folks would love to replace Microsoft Excel with tools like R, Python, Power BI, and Tableau it's simply not going to happen any time soon.After many years in the analytics trenches, my experiences have taught me to embrace Excel and: 1) Teach folks how to use it wisely. 2) Show folks a path beyond Excel when they reach Excel's limits.If my goal is to spread data literacy far and wide, isn't this a practical approach?Stay healthy and happy data sleuthing!#dataliteracy #excel #analytics #businessanalytics #dataanalytics	2022-03-03 23:35:06-05	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc

Some of the caching strategies can be used together.I left out a lot of details as that will make the post very long. Feel free to leave a comment so we can learn from each other.Question: What are the pros and cons of each caching strategy? How to choose the right one to use?Please follow me if you want to receive weekly updates about tech interviews, system design, or book writing.

302	3	6	How can we optimize performance when we    to object storage service such as S3?..Before we answer this question, let's take a look at why we need to optimize this process. Some files might be larger than a few GBs. It is possible to upload such a large object file directly, but it could take a long time. If the network connection fails in the middle of the upload, we have to start over. A better solution is to slice a large object into smaller parts and upload them independently. After all the parts are uploaded, the object store re-assembles the object from the parts. This process is called  .The diagram below illustrates how multipart upload works:1. The client calls the object storage to initiate a multipart upload.2. The data store returns an uploadID, which uniquely identifies the upload.3. The client splits the large file into small objects and starts uploading. Lets assume the size of the file is 1.6GB and the client splits it into 8 parts, so each part is 200 MB in size. The client uploads the first part to the data store together with the uploadID it received in step 2.4. When a part is uploaded, the data store returns an ETag, which is essentially the md5 checksum of that part. It is used to verify multipart uploads.5. After all parts are uploaded, the client sends a complete multipart upload request, which includes the uploadID, part numbers, and ETags.6. The data store reassembles the object from its parts based on the part number. Since the object is really large, this process may take a few minutes. After reassembly is complete, it returns a success message to the client.Question: what other techniques can be used to optimize large file upload?Please follow me if you want to receive weekly updates about tech interviews, system design, or book writing.

276	3	6	Almost all the computer and storage systems are deployed in data centers. What does a   look like?The diagram below illustrates a typical layered architecture of a data center.It contains 3 main components: the access layer, aggregation layer, and core layer. A data center contains many servers, and the servers are placed on racks. Servers are usually directly linked to the Top of Rack (TOR) switch. This kind of switch is usually placed on the top of the rack, as its name implies. When there are many racks, we need another type of switch to connect them. These switches need to provide high-bandwidth performance. They are called aggregation switches.The aggregation layer connects a lot of computing nodes together and forms a cluster. This is often called Point of Delivery (POD), or Available Zone (AZ). To ensure high availability, we need to support multiple AZs. Core switches are used to connect multiple AZs together. Core switches have even higher performance requirements.Question: do you know how storage devices are connected to the network in data centers?Please follow me if you want to receive weekly updates about tech interviews, system design, or book writing.

322	8	1	This is a demo of "LeNet 1" by Yann LeCun, the first convolutional network that could recognize handwritten digits with good speed and accuracy.It was developed between 1988 and 1993 in the Adaptive System Research Department, headed by Larry Jackel, at Bell Labs in Holmdel, NJ.This "real-time" demo shows ran on a DSP card sitting in a 486 PC with a video camera and frame grabber card. The DSP card had an AT&T DSP32C chip, which was the first 32-bit floating-point DSP and could reach an amazing 12.5 million multiply-accumulate operations per second.The network was trained using the SN environment (a Lisp-based neural net simulator, the predecessor of Lush, itself a kind of ancestor to Torch7). We wrote a kind of "compiler" in SN that produced a self-contained piece of C code that could run the network. The network weights were array literals inside the C source code. The network shown in this demo is described in our NIPS 1989 paper "Handwritten digit recognition with a back-propagation network".#innovation #artificialintelligence #datascience	2022-03-05 11:35:29-05	https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nft-guide-ai-doesnt-need-supervision-raise-natives-free-steve-nouri	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc
