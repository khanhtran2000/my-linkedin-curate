20220707	1	The Key to Fighting a Rare Disease Like ALS? Data and AIA new collaborative research effort has led to a major breakthrough in developing new treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), thanks to a massive collection of data from ANSWER ALS and the speed and problem-solving ability of an artificial intelligence-driven target discovery engine from Insilico Medicine. Initially founded with a major investment from Jay Fishman, former Chairman and CEO of the Travelers Companies, Answer ALS has been quietly amassing the largest collection of data on ALS patients in collaboration with research centers around the world, as well as a repository of patient biofluids. ALS patients volunteer at one of six clinics nationwide to donate samples. Now, a team of researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital, Johns Hopkins University, Mayo Clinic, Tsinghua University and other centers have taken that rich trove of data and used it to generate novel targets for ALS using Insilico Medicines AI platform, PandaOmics.The findings appeared in the June 28 issue of Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience.  The 28 targets discovered represent both repurposed drugs and disease-causing pathways and 18  or 70% - were validated in animal models where they were shown to moderately or strongly rescue neurodegeneration. A number of these new targets are being progressed to clinical trials for ALS. ALS is a fast-progressing neurodegenerative disease that impacts more than 700,000 people around the world. Patients with ALS lose voluntary muscle movement and the ability to walk, talk, eat and, eventually, breathe. Those with the disease typically die two to five years following the onset of symptoms and there are currently no approved drugs that halt or reverse loss of function.    	135	8	10	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D22AQFueXLxidyb3Q/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1657201878506?e=1660176000&v=beta&t=FnrQT8hkO-IV9_kGJu7DBEywy5kb33_LDB2UDZA3udk	Image	{#innovation,#artificialintelligence,#technology}	{None}

20220707	3	I am an unrepentant R fanboy. I use it in my own hands-on analytics work and I also teach professionals to use R. Why? R is the fastest, easiest way for ANY professional to unlock advanced analytics.Over the years I've successfully taught 1000s of professionals to analyze data using R programming.To be honest, it isn't nearly as an accomplishment as you might think. Let me explain.Professionals already write code in Excel everyday - they just don't think of it that way.Learning R then becomes a process of mapping what Excel users already know to R.This probably sounds too good to be true. I get the skepticism. That's why I created the PDF  to demonstrate this idea.If you like what you see in the PDF, be sure to join me on July 14th at 1:00 PM Eastern Time for a live webinar. Here's what's included: Downloadable PDF of all slides Self-study resources Live Q&A Replay access for 14 daysRegister today:  programming to unlock advanced analytics.You've got this if you want it.Stay healthy and happy data sleuthing!    	94	18	6	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc	{#excel,#microsoftexcel,#analytics,#businessanalytics,#dataanalytics}	{None}

20220707	3	I regularly speak to BI and analytics leaders accountable for raising data literacy within their organizations. These leaders have diverse experience (e.g., healthcare, manufacturing, financial services, etc.) and typically have one thing in common.They are all looking for a practical approach to planning and delivering an organizational data literacy program.The first step in these conversations is to adopt a working definition of data literacy. The following definition comes from Emerson College and MIT:"Data literacy is the ability to read, work with, analyze and argue with data."As most organization are awash in data, the above definition is just a starting point for the conversation. The next step - which data should be read, worked with, analyzed, and used in discussion?Answer - management data. Whether you call it metrics, KPIs, or OKRs; management data is the most practical place to start your data literacy program. Why?Because true organizational data literacy starts with leaders.Leaders make decisions. Leaders define culture. Leaders drive change. Leaders need to demonstrate the data literacy mindset.Are you accountable for driving data literacy in your organization?Let's talk.

20220707	3	I want to be crystal clear as to what "data-driven" does NOT mean: 1) Data-driven does not mean discarding business experience/expertise. 2) Data-driven does not mean blindly following analyses and abandoning reason.I'm going to present an absurd example to illustrate these points. As absurd as it is, many professionals (myself included) will resonate with the example, given what we have seen first-hand in our careers.Imagine a leader at an established, successful company. This leader, not surprisingly, is constantly thinking about how to make the company even more successful.The leader returns to work after a family vacation. On the flight home, the leader reads an article in a respected business periodical about the hottest upcoming consumer segment: left-handed people born in the Spring.Convinced the company should double-down on this segment, the leader drives a wholesale change in both product and marketing strategy to address left-handed people born in the Spring.This absurd example was inspired by an episode of The Simpsons. Absurd as it is, I have seen this style of "gut-driven" decisions made involving millions, even 100s of millions, of dollars.Hopefully all of us can agree that such decision processes are something organizations should avoid.The following data-driven example would be equally absurd.A Chief Analytics Officer (CAO) receives a compelling data story. The main character in this data story is the persona of left-handed people born in Spring.The gist of the story is this persona is by far the highest-converting customer segment and is radically underserved by the company's current product/marketing strategy. The story concludes with estimates of a huge untapped market.Inspired by the compelling data story, the CAO convinces leadership on a wholesale change in product/marketing strategy.Here's what a truly data-driven scenario looks like:1 - The CAO presents the data story to leaders.2 - The leaders see the potential opportunity.3 - The leaders use their experience/expertise to discuss a possible experiment to validate the opportunity.4 - The business experiment includes not only milestones, but also KPIs and clear definitions of success based on data.5 - The business experiment is executed, and data collected.6 - The leaders analyze and argue the merits of the experiment based on the data.7 - A go/no-go decision regarding the future of the opportunity is reached.Notice in this example:A - Business experience/expertise is central to the process.B - The data provides insights into a potential business opportunity.C - Leaders remain skeptical of the opportunity until it is vetted using a business experiment and data.In other words, "data-driven" doesn't mean "blinded by data."BTW - This post inspired by a comment exchange with Oz du Soleil.

20220707	3	Data literacy is my mission. For me it is not a buzzword. I've experienced first-hand how a lack of data literacy has limited the success of professionals, teams, and organizations. For today's post I will focus on the first group - professionals.My experiences have taught me that the future will be data-driven. In this future, employers will expect a certain level of data skills.I remember when it was commonplace to list your skills with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on your resume/CV. I've been a hiring manager and I haven't seen anyone do this for many years.Employers just expect a certain level of skills with MS Office. It will be the same with data.Here's the good news.Any professional can learn data skills. All you need is Excel and the motivation to put in the time.If you're ready to be a part of the data-driven future, I've created hours of free resources to build your skills:  2022 the year you have more impact at work using data.Stay healthy and happy data sleuthing!    	104	15	7	https://www.daveondata.com/free-analytics-tutorials	Article	{#dataliteracy,#excel,#analytics,#businessanalytics,#data}	{None}

20220707	3	Being a hands-on analytics instructor is one of my primary creative outlets. For example, teaching the math of analytics to professionals from diverse roles/backgrounds requires a creative approach.Take the slide below. This slide is part of a lesson from my upcoming online course on the log-likelihood calculation used to craft logistic regression models.For Excel users interested in performing logistic regression analyses, an understanding of this calculation is critical for building the worksheet calculations.While the math can be intimidating at first, unpacking the calculation step-by-step and explaining the "why" of the math makes learning the math quite intuitive.If you're interested in learning more about logistic regression using Excel and R, I will be releasing the full lesson video as a free preview on July 8th.Comment  if you would like to get on the waitlist and get access to more than 90 minutes of free lesson videos.

20220707	3	As much as I love Excel Power Query, there are still situations where Power Query can't get the job done. In these situations, I've had to go outside of Excel. Not anymore.To be honest, I was late in discovering Power Query, but it didn't take me long to become a fan. Simply put, Power Query is a game changer.Power Query addresses so many needs and you can do so much with it. I like Power Query so much, I've published hours of YouTube tutorials on the feature.All that being said, Power Query can't do everything.That's where the Basic Excel R Toolkit (BERT) comes into play. BERT is a free Excel add-in that allows you to use R directly inside Excel - including automating Excel using the same interface as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Need the power of the mighty dplyr? Check. Want full access to regular expressions via stringr? Check. Processing text? How about quanteda inside Excel. Most excellent.Check out the PDF  demonstrating dplyr and regular expresssion data wrangling inside Excel.One last thing I should mention - unleashing the power of R is easy for Excel users. If you've got Excel skills, learning R is quite simple.Skeptical of that last statement?I invite you to join me for a free live webinar - "Why R Programming Is Easy."

20220707	4	How are notifications pushed to our phones or PCs?..A messaging solution (Firebase) can be used to support the notification push.This post is written by Hua Li. Follow her (Hua Li) to learn more about distributed systems.The diagram below shows how Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) works.FCM is a cross-platform messaging solution that can compose, send, queue, and route notifications reliably. It provides a unified API between message senders (app servers) and receivers (client apps). The app developer can use this solution to drive user retention.Steps 1 - 2: When the client app starts for the first time, the client app sends credentials to FCM, including Sender ID, API Key, and App ID. FCM generates Registration Token for the client app instance (so the Registration Token is also called Instance ID). This token must be included in the notifications.Step 3: The client app sends the Registration Token to the app server. The app server caches the token for subsequent communications. Over time, the app server has too many tokens to maintain, so the recommended practice is to store the token with timestamps and to remove stale tokens from time to time.Step 4: There are two ways to send messages. One is to compose messages directly in the console GUI (Step 4.1,) and the other is to send the messages from the app server (Step 4.2.) We can use the Firebase Admin SDK or HTTP for the latter.Step 5: FCM receives the messages, and queues the messages in the storage if the devices are not online.Step 6: FCM forwards the messages to platform-level transport. This transport layer handles platform-specific configurations.Step 7: The messages are routed to the targeted devices. The notifications can be displayed according to the configurations sent from the app server [1].Over to you: We can also send messages to a topic (just like Kafka) in Step 4. When should the client app subscribe to the topic?Reference Material: Google firebase documentationSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to learn something new every week:   .	1042	9	64	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQEd1Yi2tBxmmQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1657208611143?e=1660176000&v=beta&t=tbdehRE8xl7RPcQUs3IHfBU2FzNxS9QMoTNhJn8i0Es	Image	{#systemdesign,#coding,#interviewtips}	{None}
20220707	4	We just published a YouTube video that explains how to store passwords in the database safely.You can find the link to our YouTube channel at the end of the post.If you prefer text, you can keep reading:    Storing passwords in plain text is not a good idea because anyone with internal access can see them. Storing password hashes directly is insufficient because it is pruned to precomputation attacks, such as rainbow tables. To mitigate precomputation attacks, we salt the passwords.  ?According to OWASP guidelines, a salt is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password as part of the hashing process.      ?1 A salt is not meant to be secret and it can be stored in plain text in the database. It is used to ensure the hash result is unique to each password.2 The password can be stored in the database using the following format: (  + ).    ?To validate a password, it can go through the following process:1 A client enters the password.2 The system fetches the corresponding salt from the database.3 The system appends the salt to the password and hashes it. Lets call the hashed value H1.4 The system compares H1 and H2, where H2 is the hash stored in the database. If they are the same, the password is valid.Over to you: what other mechanisms can we use to ensure password safety?

20220707	4	What are some of the algorithms you should know before taking system design interviews?I put together a list and explained why they are important. Those algorithms are not only useful for interviews but good to understand for any software engineer.One thing to keep in mind is that understanding how those algorithms are used in real-world systems is generally more important than the implementation details in a system design interview.What do the stars mean in the diagram?Its very difficult to rank algorithms by importance objectively. Im open to suggestions and making adjustments.Five-star: Very important. Try to understand how it works and why. Three-star: Important to some extent. You may not need to know the implementation details.One-star: Advanced. Good to know for senior candidates.If you are interested in learning more about those algorithms, I put together a   in our blog/newsletter so you can read everything in one place.

20220707	4	How do we implement a - queue? What are the differences between blocking and non-blocking algorithms?This post is written by Hua LiThe terms we use when discussing blocking and non-blocking algorithms can be confusing, so lets start by reviewing the terminology in the concurrency area with a diagram.blockingThe blocking algorithm uses locks. Thread A acquires the lock first, and Thread B might wait for arbitrary lengthy periods if Thread A gets suspended while holding the lock. This algorithm may cause Thread B to starve.non-blocking:The non-blocking algorithm allows Thread A to access the queue, but Thread A must complete a task in a certain number of steps. Other threads like Thread B may still starve due to the rejections.This is the main  between blocking and non-blocking algorithms: The blocking algorithm blocks Thread B until the lock is released. A non-blocking algorithm notifies Thread B that access is rejected.starvation-free:Thread Starvation means a thread cannot acquire access to certain shared resources and cannot proceed. Starvation-free means this situation does not occur.wait-free:All threads can complete the tasks within a finite number of steps.- = - + - Non-Blocking Queue We can use Compare and Swap (CAS) to implement a non-blocking queue. The diagram below illustrates the algorithm. 1. No thread suspension. Thread B can get a response immediately and then decide what to do next. In this way, the thread latency is greatly reduced.2. No deadlocks. Threads A and B do not wait for the lock to release, meaning that there is no possibility of a deadlock occurring.Subscribe to our weekly newsletter to learn something new every week:   .	2860	39	167	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQEbwFGBGCGJdg/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1656686250199?e=1660176000&v=beta&t=67Ho9VAzT7fhoKYBlPNVs60ZHDA1mOkP3hHkK0rL9rw	Image	{#systemdesign,#coding,#interviewtips}	{None}
20220707	4	What is Distributed SQL? Why do we need it? How does it work?..Google's Spanner popularized the term distributed SQL database in 2012. Distributed SQL databases    across multiple nodes and are  . Paxos or Raft algorithms are commonly used to achieve consensus across multiple nodes.Examples of Distributed SQL databases: Google Spanner, Amazon Aurora, CockroachDB, YugabyteDB, TiDB, etc.A few weeks ago, I met the CTO of TiDB Ed Huang, and a few other team members. We discussed how Distributed SQL databases evolved and how TiDB developed its own open-sourced database. After that conversation, I read more documentation/source code about it and I found it to be an interesting case study. I want to share my learning here.Terms:OLTP = Online transactional processingOLAP = Online analytical processingHTAP = Hybrid transaction/analytical processingThe life of an OLTP query (marked with  sequence numbers):Step 1. A client sends a MySQL query and the query is interpreted by TiDB, a stateless SQL layer that interprets the MySQL protocol.Step 2: TiDB requests data mapping/placement information from the placement driver (PD).Step 3: PD responds with data mapping/ placement instructions & timestamp.Step 4: TiDB executes queries on TiKV servers (row-based storage).Step 5, 6: Query results are sent back to the client.The life of a complex  query: marked with  sequence numbers.Over to you: do you think the terms OLTP and OLAP have become obsolete or are they still very relevant? When should we use distributed SQL databases vs traditional relational databases?Subscribe to our weekly newsletter to learn something new every week:   .	1996	25	126	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQGEejp-E3Yt2Q/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1656603432448?e=1660176000&v=beta&t=NTLpMW1CAUqWPFdSflld3STMh0X1gEm9hLrWgBJGGfA	Image	{#systemdesign,#coding,#interviewtips}	{None}

20220707	5	Over a year ago, when I was looking into how to leverage streaming technologies to speed up machine learning workflows, I asked people who the best person to talk about streaming was, and they pointed me to Zhenzhong Xu. He was, at that time, leading the streaming data platform at Netflix.It took me 8 months to convince him to start a company with me, but it's worth it :-) He's the best co-founder one could ask for.This post summarizes his learnings during his 6.5 years at Netflix, leading their effort transitioning from the batch pipeline to the streaming pipeline, then scaling their platform to support 2000 data use cases across Netflix.I learned a ton from reading this post, both about the challenges of implementing a modern streaming data platform, and about building an environment that allows engineers to make bets on impactful technologies without the fear of failures.Here are some of the key learnings.1. When building the MVP product, focus on the few customers with general use cases instead of custom use cases.2. Co-evolve with technology partners even if not in an ideal maturity stateinstead of reinventing the wheels on our own.3. Invest in building a system that expects failures and monitors all operations (this reminds of Etsys motto to monitor everything that moves).4. Avoid exposing infrastructure complexities to users (choose ease of use for users over flexibility)5. Start with streaming ETL and observability use casesversus tackling all custom streaming use cases all at once.6. When things break, dont panic. Zhenzhong's team broke everything they touched, from AWS S3 to Flink to Spinnaker. As a team, they solved these problems one by one.    	788	13	36	https://zhenzhongxu.com/the-four-innovation-phases-of-netflixs-trillions-scale-real-time-data-infrastructure-2370938d7f01	Article	{#dataplatform,#realtimemachinelearning,#mlops,#streamingdata,#dataengineering}	{None}

Leverage online reviews, resources, or colleagues' feedback. Post about it and ask on LinkedIn!2. Align the resources with how you learn best. Maybe it is a book, maybe it is a YouTube channel or an interactive training. Be hyper-focused on what works for YOU.3. Prioritize relentlessly. Your time is worth a ton. Don't let it be overtaken by suggestions by others. Choose what you want to do - it is your time.4. Set aside a time window for that skill. Don't let other tutorials, recommendations or material distract you. That time is focused on that skill and that skill alone. Learn it deeply.5. Continue to iterate. Add in a new skill as you wind down on this one. Know that skills will overlap and that is okay.Tune out the noise. Focus deeply.

It should be for everyone, and companies lose out by avoiding the conversation. 5 reasons why (I think) companies need to invest here:1. Companies make many decisions. If data is going be part of them, understanding the limits of data matters. People need to understand those limits.2. The ideas of central tendency dont require computation as much as they require intuition. Its critical to get right. For example, why is it important to collect a "certain number of observations" for validity?3. Knowing how to summarize data in thoughtful ways shouldnt just be a data science function. It should be a common practice. When to use mean/median, when to show a distribution, these are core issues for all of us.4. If companies want to scale, data must be an asset for all, not an asset for just a few. It is hard to scale if all data skill is concentrated in a few people.5. Knowing how to collect data to be useful for later analysis isnt just the job of a statistician. Everyone is invested, and eventually, everyone pays the price or reaps the benefit.Data literacy might sound strange, but companies that invest here almost certainly have an advantage go forward.	176	12	7	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc	{#datascience,#statistics,#machinelearning,#analytics}	{None}

Resources are located in different nodes connected through high-speed network. As a result, each resource type improves its utilization rate and expands its volume independently. This also eliminates fate sharing, allowing each resource be recovered from failure and upgraded independently. Moreover, data pages in the remote memory pool can be shared among multiple database processes, analogous to the storage pool being shared in shared storage architecture.

20220708	11	I recently was going through some of the sessions from Intel Vision 2022, and one of the things that really caught my attention was NEX (Network & Edge Group). I have been fascinated to learn more about edge computing and how it would work in a multi-cloud environment. Over the years we have seen a massive improvement in both data latency and compute power, and this is where edge devices are going to bring a revolution of newer technology. The shift is from fixed functional technology devices to fully programmable devices running on a network. The vision for enterprises to adopt edge-based solutions would involve a revamp of the data stack and adopt edge-native software and AI strategy. This would mean building custom solutions that would reside in the edge devices and make the process of data collection and processing seamless. The edge solutions would also involve inferential models for business decisions, which would fall under the multi-cloud strategy. Now, there are challenges around real-time processing which are robust toward network issues, and that is what the edge-solutions are designed for. Edge-computing is also a stepping stone into having ethical AI solutions considering data privacy, governance and using federated learning models. The talk covered a case-study about using federated learning methods for healthcare optimization during COVID19 times.It was a super insightful talk by Sachin Katti, CTO -NEX, Intel and Parsa Mirhaji, Director , Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center.

20220708	13	When you are building a house, you do not invest in AC when the homeowners already have heat stroke, in running water when they are dehydrated, and in a bathroom when they are dirty. However, this is exactly how we build modern data ecosystems. Companies do not invest in monitoring until the data starts to fail and no one knows why or when.They do not invest in better systems of governance until ownership issues are causing tremendous pain across the org.They do not invest in data quality until teams can't trust the decisions they make. They do not invest in semantics until no one understands what certain tables mean or how common concepts are represented.They do not invest in data architecture or modeling...ever?This is not reasonable to me, it seems like complete insanity propped up by a multi-billion data industry. Lauren Balik and others who are commenting on this phenomenon have it right - incrementalism and point solutions for the data ecosystem have resulted in this industry regressing 30+ years on the value, usefulness, and trustworthiness of data.It doesn't, and shouldn't have to be this way.	201	41	9	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc	{None}	{None}
20220708	13	There are major problems with the implementation of Change Data Capture (CDC) as it is practiced today. CDC replicates the flaws of poorly designed databases into analytical environments. Here are 8 reasons CDC must be paired with upfront design to prevent Data Swamps:1. Databases are not built for analytics Analytics and Operational use cases are not the same. What is sufficient for one, may not work for the other. 2. Database design does not facilitate strong business-based data modelingAnalytics explores the relationships between real-world business entities. If services fail to capture these relationships upstream, downstream usage becomes much more challenging.3. Key data points may be completely missingAnalytics often requires information at key points in time that services do not need to maintain operations. That data will simply not exist and must be reverse-engineered downstream.4. Data teams inherit the complexity and tech debt of the serviceDatabases evolve over time and are subject to tech debt and institutional knowledge. CDC forces the Lake/Warehouse to inherit this complexity even if no one is aware of it.5. Having the right data is more important than having more dataAnalytics teams often believe they need 'all' the data, when in reality over 75% of the data we collect goes completely unused. Making sure the data we need exists is more relevant.6. Critical business concepts lack ownership If the data for foundational entities breaks or becomes untrustworthy, every downstream report, ML model, and experiment loses its trust as well. Strong owners are needed versus tossing things over the fence.7. Data teams spend hours grokking how data points were implementedThere is almost no 'analytics-based' documentation for production databases. Data consumers must frequently speak to engineers to understand how certain things were implemented, why, and the context behind that decision which costs hours to days of time. 8. Data Quality suffersBecause engineers pay no attention to how data is used outside the service, changing column names or otherwise modifying the database can have unintentional and severe consequences downstream.Does all this mean I believe CDC is bad? No, quite the contrary. I think CDC is an excellent mechanism for capturing changes to our databases (ideally in real-time). However, if the data IN our databases is not designed well from the start, lacks clear ownership, has no connection to the downstream, and is missing context/business application CDC will continue to be a perpetual thorn in the side for analytics and machine learning programs. I believe that by focusing on real-world events expressed as schema designed in advance through the collaboration of data consumers, data developers, and software engineers, not only will analytical environments become an order of magnitude more meaningful, but operational use cases will greatly improve as well.	255	20	7	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc	{None}	{None}
20220708	13	Operational data and Analytical data should be decoupled at the source. The way data is collected and stored to run applications is often a subset of the requirements to answer complex business questions with far fewer dependencies. As an example, consider pricing data. When Convoy prices a shipment the application may only need a few details such as the shipper, the pick-up location, the drop-off location, and other data points germane to its distance and current market prices. However, the moment a shipment gets priced is a critical time for analytics. Data teams want to know the state of the shipment when the price was finalized, so additional details about the type of the shipment, the contents of the load, its revenue program, the amount of time the shipment had been on the marketplace, and many more data points are extremely relevant for teams to understand how their features or programs are affecting marketplace dynamics.This data is irrelevant to day-to-day service operations. Oftentimes engineering teams struggle to understand why they should care about emitting certain data points from their service, resulting in inexplicable, unscalable SQL being written within the Warehouse that attempts to infer what should be collected in production.Secondly, data quality and data contracts are of critical importance to downstream teams. For example, let's imagine that my team owns a Machine Learning model which consumes point-in-time data once the shipment is finalized in order to predict the ideal bid for an auction.My training set includes data from the Pricing service, Shipper tables, and data on our current market prices. I expect that columns are NEVER dropped, that the values of each field ALWAYS remain the same, and that the business context/logic is NEVER altered. If any of the above occurs my model will break and will have a sizable production impact.This can be problematic for service teams who must be allowed to flexibly decide what their databases look like in order to facilitate changing business use cases. They can't be bottlenecked on analytics/ML applications if the name of a column should be changed to improve the quality of the service. The answer is to create an abstraction between operational data and other downstream consumers of data for analytical purposes. At Convoy, we do this by leveraging technologies similar to Protobuf (an internal IDL) and Kafka to provide an SDK for engineering teams to implement service-based events as schema and treated as an API. This model allows engineers to emit the data that downstream teams require in the shape that it's needed. Data APIs are versioned with strong CI/CD and change management. Internal service details are not exposed to the greater organization allowing for personal flexibility. Data consumers define what they NEED, instead of being forced to accept what's coming from production even if it is of low quality or missing critical components for their use cases.	253	36	7	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc	{None}	{None}
20220708	13	The Knowledge Layer will become one of the most important data investments any company will make in the next five years. This layer captures the semantic context of real-world entities, events, and their properties which are inherited by downstream data applications and tables.Instead of emitting purely operational CDC events and transforming the data numerous times in a complex, brittle pipeline to reverse engineer real-world behavior - teams will define the data they need UP FRONT and pass SLAs and quality onto engineering. Engineers emit events expressed as schema directly from production - effectively treating data assets as an API. Here are the top benefits of such a system:1. Ownership: Teams no longer have to wonder about who owns which table producing critical business data. Ownership of entities and semantic events are mapped directly to the service-producing the data, which is directly connected to datasets generated from source tables.2. Better Integration of Data Consumers into the Product Development Lifecycle: Typically, data consumers exist on the outskirts of product development, analyzing the data once it's made available but infrequently participating in the evolution of features. As the owners of business logic, data consumers are now responsible for helping to define the data product workflow, interfacing with engineers to generate the data they need and validating the semantic accuracy of the data as it flows into the Warehouse.3. Quality where it belongs: Data scientists are rarely equipped with the tools or skills to both deliver business value and to manage data quality at scale. A knowledge layer allows data consumers to focus on the evolution of the business without worrying about the technical skillsets required to manage upkeep cost, scalability, and schema evolution.4. Iterative Modeling: By expressing real-world events and entities as schema, teams can take an iterative approach to modeling. For example, perhaps for an event like 'inbound email received' the communications team only cares about the subject, threadID, sent_time, and other email related attributes. However, they quickly realize without the corresponding workItemID it is challenging to link email threads to customer service tickets. In this framework, adding workItemID to the email event schema is trivial and highly accurate, whereas attempting to build that link in the Warehouse is complex, requires fuzzy matching logic, and will be off by an order of magnitude.An abstraction between the real world and production code that describes the various components of the business expressed through schema is THE missing piece in the data stack in my opinion. This model encourages deep collaboration between data producers and consumers, which results in some fascinating conversations about how the business works, what data should be owned by who, and presents a surface for managing the evolution of data assets over time.	199	29	3	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc	{None}	{None}

20220708	13	Daily reminder that despite the amazing technology in the Modern Data Stack, the core of any data infrastructure is the data itself. If that data has no connection to business value, is devoid of context, has no clear producer/owner, is poorly designed, and can't play nicely with other semantic concepts, all the money in the world won't turn your 'stack' from a cost center to a value add.Be careful not to over-optimize for 'second order' data impacts. Yes, being able to pull massive amounts of data in batch/real-time is very cool. Yes, monitoring is awesome and useful. Yes, it's true that excellent BI is incredibly important. But please remember that some of the most valuable data infrastructures in the world (orders of magnitude more valuable than most modern data set-ups today) were built without ANY of these modern technologies. With a solid foundation of well-designed data that maps back to real-world meaning then the Modern Data Stack is an incredible addition to any data team's infrastructure. But without it, organizations are layering complexity on top of a ruined foundation - marred by spiraling tech debt. Always prioritize the data first.	991	73	40	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D22AQGaJLTAsWhvEQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1656434580633?e=1660176000&v=beta&t=O0nhflkcKyurL3rtw6d0a7nXkWDQEBimLOJvOHUQtkw	Image	{None}	{None}
20220708	13	Data producers, Warehouse developers, and Data consumers are completely siloed in most modern data organizations. Consumers constantly ask for new dashboards, metrics, and tables with no understanding of the complexities required to generate data.These types of asks are repeatedly thrown over the fence to Warehouse developers who are treated less like innovative members of the product/infrastructure team and more like service teams with an ever-increasing backlog. Data developers often lack the business context to truly understand how the data will be leveraged, model it effectively, and make it useful for multiple teams across the org. Meanwhile upstream, data producers consistently dump data from production databases into the Data Lake / Data Swamp. While this data is primarily leveraged for operational use cases, it becomes the backbone of critical analytics and Machine Learning models in the Warehouse. Despite this, service engineers typically have no idea how this data is used, why it's important to the company, and what might happen if fields or columns or dropped.Product Managers and business folks are unaware of how these siloes form and are frustrated by how long it takes to answer seemingly simple questions about new features or experiments. This results in additional headcount being added to teams to address issues of speed, data quality, and efficiency - but stacking more bloat atop an unscalable foundation isn't the answer.The solution to this problem is to reverse the data-development workflow. Instead of engineers throwing operational data over the fence and expecting teams to make due with it, data should be treated as a product. That means clear requirements stemming from business use cases, and data being emitted deliberately from the source as events with clearly defined and well-designed schema. Data developers should be brought into each request from the beginning, with software engineers taking an active role in data ownership and quality management. This is the system we have implemented at Convoy, and the amount of cross-functional conversations about the data we have, the data we need, and how the business works has been incredible to see. Amazing new technology won't break cultural siloes - but people collaborating more effectively certainly can.	275	31	6	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc	{None}	{None}

20220708	13	Collectively, we must stop treating data specialists as if they are software engineers. They are NOT. Their needs, ownership model, incentives, org structure, skillsets, and tools are totally different and must be specifically tailored for the unique challenges that arise from working with data.One common example I hear data engineers and infrastructure teams rant about frequently is testing and documentation. Testing/Documentation within the Warehouse for data assets is terrible, and usually, data specialists (analysts, data scientists, ML engineers, etc) are blamed for poor quality and expected to 'do better.' However, consider what is expected from data specialists in their daily roles. They are not viewed as traditional 'engineers' by the business and are rarely held to the same promotional standards. They are almost never judged on the quality of their code. They are often seen as extensions of the product role - delivering direct business value through analysis and experimentation instead of developers responsible for the maintenance of scalable systems. There is a massive time cost for 'doing things right' and if they are not being judged or rewarded for that investment, what is the incentive for doing it?Secondly, Data scientists and analysts are typically never trained on robust data modeling, data warehouse development, or maintaining and solving data quality issues. There are few tools they can use to make the ownership of these processes in the Warehouse simpler. They often must inherit a legacy code base that they do not understand, nor did they build, and even if they did everything right might be on the hook to play Sherlock Holmes for data quality issues they have no control over. Even if all the processes were improved, the business altered their promotional guidelines, and they were provided tools that allowed them to better model, document, and take control of quality, if they are working with data assets which are tossed over the fence from software engineers in (ironically poorly documented production databases) their world may be rocked at any moment by upstream changes which break production models or critical dashboards and they have no method of understanding how or why this has happened. My perspective? Data Quality should be owned by the team that is directly responsible for and judged on building maintainable scalable systems: software engineers. All the tools to do this today exist (protocol buffers, Kafka, etc). What must change is an acknowledgment that data assets generated from production are indeed data products, data consumers are customers, and ongoing maintenance and quality management are critical business functions.	318	57	6	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc	{None}	{None}
20220708	14	3 ways to do BI: query , semantic, and dataset-centric. I've seen all three in action and come to the same conclusion as the author, Maxime Beauchemin: "[recognizing] the strengths and tradeoffs for each of the approaches [the] dataset-centric approach is the ideal one for fast-moving data teams."The key word is "fast-moving". While the semantic approach offers the most flexibility, dataset-centric delivers speed and consistency through denormalization and supporting documentation. The dataset-centric approach has been one of the main drivers of  success for tools like Tableau and Max is betting on it doing the same for Preset.	30	3	3	https://preset.io/blog/dataset-centric-visualization/	Article	{None}	{None}

20220708	17	Here's a good lesson and something to chew on about data pipelines.Today, OpenSea, an NFT marketplace valued at over $13 billion where people trade JPEGs, where the former Head of Product is currently being prosecuted by law enforcement for insider trading of JPEGs, has announced that: There has been a major security breach!An employee of Customer.io allegedly took customer data and gave it to a third-party.--What is Customer.io?It's data pipelines, with a UI that allows non-technical or semi-technical users to make workflows based on conditional logic."Person X visited our site 5 days ago and did a thing. Therefore Person X gets this message and this drip campaign.""Person Y downloaded this thing, then downloaded that thing, therefore Person Y now gets bucketed into this other thing."Take the data from one system, move it to another, then do X,Y,Z with it.--This is data sprawl gone mad.The data pipeline vendor Customer.io had an employee who was able to access this customer data (that's questionable in and of itself) and because this data has a monetary value associated with it that has increased because OpenSea is leaking so much blood into the water, someone with access they shouldn't have had sold this data.--Now, in the OpenSea press release and in the media on this, it suggests this breach is email addresses. While this is probably technically true, I seriously doubt it's one giant list of 1.8 million email addresses. There's probably other data in there around locations and stuff that is trades or is likely to be able to proxy to trades.Who knows!--But wait. It gets better.Are these 1.8 million customers, as in individual human beings?I seriously doubt it. Did OpenSea do KYC - "Know Your Customer" - which is how financial institutions are held accountable to preventing money laundering?Well, no, OpenSea has historically not done KYC.So now you've got an entity that doesn't do KYC - "Know Your Customer" - that has publicly stated many times they don't do KYC, making low-code marketing data pipelines in Customer.io to re-target and re-market to "customers" who may or may not even be real customers.It's too funny. They don't know who many of their customers are and they make data pipelines to re-market to these customers using a tool called Customer.io.There's almost no diligence anywhere in tech around what data is getting shot around where. Complete Wild West. --So the lesson here:-Do you know what data pipelines exist at your company?-Who is making pipelines and moving data in and out of various systems?Data engineers? Marketing? Analytics engineers? Finance people taking csv dumps out of Tableau and then pivot tabling them and then uploading them into another system?The amount of data moving in and out of places has exploded in the last few years.Maybe it's time to take stock. Maybe you shouldn't have 15 "unbundled" data vendors with little to no governance!	91	33	3	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQFn1Jhu86EHbg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1656602932497?e=1660176000&v=beta&t=dMz1kgb41Fk4iqqSHbWhMDhbXlxTyFOXsRhWtlsZ090	Image	{None}	{None}
20220708	17	The multi-billion dollar economy of shoveling data around can be examined through the case of Gorgias, one of my favorite SaaS businesses to study and watch.Gorgias is a helpdesk for Shopify. Customer support tickets, etc.They've carved out a niche in longtail and mid-size ecommerce merchants, with a few large accounts.Because they are a bit specialized in their product/GTM a lot of GMs and managers have them top of mind vs. more generalized helpdesks like Zendesk or Freshdesk, etc.--Go ask your friendly neighborhood Head of Data at a Shopify store about Gorgias war stories.-Gorgias does maintenance on their API during the week, and it gets brought down with no warning. This breaks workflows of anyone using it.-The rate limiting and speed at which you can actually interact with the API is so poor that often the only way to do this is to load the whole thing in from scratch.-Historically have been using offset-based pagination, but now moving to cursor-based pagination.-I could go on and on...--See, here's how Gorgias data projects are made.Someone says, "Let's analyze what our CS reps are doing and see their impact, tie it to revenue. That way we can manage our individual contributor CS reps, see what meaningful impact they have on retention, see what the impact of certain tickets and issue types is on customer retention."All good things that make sense!But *where* do you do this? You can potentially do the IPaaS route and start shooting revenue and helpdesk data from app-to-app. This is a bad idea.Or, you can bring the helpdesk + revenue data from two different systems into Snowflake, then sort it out there, tie it together, etc. then put it on a Looker or Tableau or whatever dashboard.This makes sense on paper.This is the Modern Data Stack and ELT approach.It's a supply chain.Manufacturer -> Distributor -> RetailApplication -> Data Warehouse -> BI/AnalyticsThis would work in theory, but the problem is that Gorgias APIs break all the time.Now - at a customer - maybe there is a set of Looker dashboards and products that the CS team is using to do weekly team meetings or do 1x1s. This becomes part of operations.But...then Gorgias, which has historically underinvested in their data capabilities, has their APIs break or they decide to do maintenance on a random Tuesday afternoon.So the dashboards break or go out of date until Gorgias gets it together.The flow of data is dead.CS gets mad. "Looker is broken, the data team is bad."Credibility is lost. Time and money are wasted. People run in circles.--My take?Maybe you shouldn't bring in Gorgias data in the first place! It's expensive to play data games for limited returns.See, I think data quality needs to be part of procurements with a charge back model.One of the problems in procuring free or low ACV software is that there's no leverage to charge back a vendor. Because of this, overhead and ops/data costs bloat. 	33	17	1	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQGWFmn-aYB95g/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1656513212588?e=1660176000&v=beta&t=pwC7fYfO64YCGAPUMlDY7-C21_0beVycerg7Pj1QUR8	Image	{None}	{None}

20220708	17	Later this week I am going to challenge Benn Stancil on the validity of the in-warehouse metrics layer and demonstrate how the patent protected AtScale semantic layer will win this space.But right now the people want to know Lauren's No BS opinion on Reverse ETL and this is because I live in reality and because I live in reality I offer my take:1. Reverse ETL is an invented venture capital term made in order to define a category. The primer on this was made by a VC at Redpoint, now running her own thing. (link in comments)2. The biggest limiting factor of RETL as a category is that it presumes there is decent enough modeling in the data warehouse to support it. Because of this, I personally see a limited TAM among dbt adopters, Airflow/SQL-heavy adopters. It presumes a lot of spend and overhead in headcount, cloud spend, etc. is occurring to make this happen. I think this is risky!3. A lot of older, wiser people call RETL an anti-pattern. I can see the validity to this, mostly because of 2.4. Many people say this is a "feature" not its own product, and therefore productized "Reverse ETL" will have a lower TAM and lower valuation than an EL solution like Fivetran. I generally agree with this!--Now, there's been a divergence in the GTM of the two main reverse ETL players Census and Hightouch.Both will compete on a war of attrition for 10k-40k deals downmarket as their limited TAM longtail, but on the more margin-rich deals they have diverged.Hightouch has taken a "data activation" and "composable CDP" approach. They are focusing GTM on the revenue-center of marketing teams, and building what I think is better Segment features that never came to full fruition (the founding team and many employees are ex-Segment). However, they still will rely on a Braze or ESP or message delivery (right now) to make this a fully packaged solution, which is a risk.Census has embraced "operational analytics" and thus competes more in the world of RevOps/SalesOps at least from a GTM perspective.Thus, the headwinds here are the operational teams already using Workato or Tray.io or similar tools, which is a risk.--Of other players, Grouparoo was acquired by Airbyte and Castled has pivoted to be a CDP/segmentation tool.Out of Australia, Omnata offers RETL. Good founders!Plus, MessageGears has this baked in though they sell to marketers and revenue people who *use* data, not data people who are *doing* a marketing project.Also, Rivery and Keboola and RudderStack have these as features already. So do many enterprise platforms...--My take?Reverse ETL was never a category or a standalone company.Just as improv comedy troupes train their performers to say, "Yes, and?" so too are these RETLs figuring out their "Yes, and?" situations.I personally think Census is making a riskier bet going after operational analytics, where Hightouch is going after revenue customers who will demand more customization.It's interesting!	68	20	2	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQF3Hnx6xB1YvQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1656374295352?e=1660176000&v=beta&t=XI81Ukq1d42jq1YNOX-1egvdBWJi65U9yKrAOPh_c3A	Image	{None}	{None}
20220708	17	One reason the Modern Data Stack is dead  is closely related to the growing discourse around data ethics that will come into the primetime due to the US political atmosphere.This may upset you and you may not like it if you are a young, bright-eyed data engineer, analytics engineer, analyst, data scientist, or whatever.However...There is actually very little incremental value to your company created in producing "insights" and "experimentation" and incremental metrics and in making pipelines and infrastructure that support these behaviors. It's mostly just a lot of capital inefficient running around.You've been told - not a lie - but a semi-truth, a pipe dream if you wish to call it that.If you're doing the Modern Data Stack there is almost certainly more value given back to cloud providers and the satellite vendors in the form of cloud credits and technographics than there is in value generated at your business.--As Bob Dylan says, "The times they are a-changin'..."Money is no longer free.The data a company collects is an asset, and that asset can be used as collateral or sold for cash...And now many businesses are struggling...They need collateral and/or cash...--I already see many smaller and smaller businesses seeking to sell or borrow off their data assets. Customer data, location data, purchasing behavior...These businesses - both B2B and B2C - are beginning to realize that by lowering ASPs and discounting, they may smoke their unit margins on product sales on paper, but they will get access to more transactional and behavioral data that not only recoups this lost margin but is actually way more valuable!--Many companies give their surplus value right back to the comically unbundled, spread out Modern Data Stack.Surplus value of the data generated at your company goes right back to venture capital, which takes minuscule management fees off it.  It's a huge market inefficiency. I also see this a major reason why much of the ELT paradigm will die off as the demand for companies to monetize their data increases and the barriers become lowered. Not all of ELT will die off, but a lot of it just might!--Of course, this comes with all sorts of ethical considerations when you're selling data.But let's be honest, there are very few ethics, security, or governance in companies that operate the MDS already. Most companies can't even keep track of the PII they shoot around willy-nilly!In fact, turning your company into a data rentier state and capitalizing your company's data may actually be the *driver* of ethics, security, and governance.Companies need to shape up their data compliance to have the Right to Play in this new operating paradigm as it moves downmarket.--Who else is working on this on the distribution side? Who is actually making data into the new oil?Lots to unpack!	50	17	1	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQEVC2dVQFYidA/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1656274926855?e=1660176000&v=beta&t=Jn8UmMU3uHP0B7W8qwndqO7XDcy55YFxGj2jvU6jyNI	Image	{None}	{None}

Many leaders in RevOps, Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Product ask me all the time why absolutely nothing gets done with data anymore and why does the data team rack up a bajillion dollars a year in costs.The answer is that the Modern Data Stack is full of dirty deeds done dirt cheap!--Let's break down Airbyte.-classic community-led, bottoms-up distro common of free or cheap data infra solutioning-uses both a community-development model + company supported connectors-been around for 2+ years, hundreds of millions in funding, valuation north of $1B--If you peel  back the onion  nothing makes sense at all.-Why has a company been around for 2 years yet only has like 9 GA, functional connectors? These are solved problems.-Why are there over 2,000 open Github issues?-Why haven't basic features like column/attribute level masking/hashing been properly implemented? These are necessary for PII and some customer data protection. Huge barrier to enterprise accounts.-Why are they constantly using # of Github Stars as a measure of success, on their fundraising decks, on marketing materials, etc.?--Functionally, in its current state, after 2+ years, hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, dozens of employees passing through, this product as both the OSS and cloud offering are disasters.Go look at the Airbyte Slack community.The comments and inquiries get more absurd by the day.-One guy is spending $10,000 a day to load in csv files to BigQuery via Airbyte.-One guy got trapped by "analysis" done on BigQuery via his Airbyte connection. Run rate of $22k per year + whatever cost is eaten up by his time.-and all kinds of other crazy stuff when you poke around.These messages are in Dark Mode in the comments.This is because there are dark, dirty deeds done dirt cheap in the Modern Data Stack.--But there is hope!See, I got a nice message from a data engineer the other day thanking me for warning him about Airbyte. He didn't waste his company's time. He didn't put his credibility or even job at risk by blowing up cloud spend and fooling around with fundamentally broken products and business models.He found:Real solutions His message is in Light Mode in the comments.If you stick with Lauren Balik you too can be in the light!See, here is the secret of Airbyte:It's not one project...It's HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS wrapped under one name!There is no such thing as a data engineering or analytics engineering shortage.There is only a common sense shortage, a best practice shortage, a proper management behavior shortage, a shortage of firing people, and a shortage of realistic interest rates.RIP Modern Data Stack2017 - 2022Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap	78	35	0	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQFHdpHRjPMkYw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1655595072686?e=1660176000&v=beta&t=qYM3xln3bwJcFKq8mOolht2F3YVt433lG3CEBiebNps	Image	{None}	{None}

20220708	18	A common mistake in machine learning project evaluation is only using research metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc. Good metrics should connect to the end users. For example, good metrics might look like an increase in revenue or decrease in churn, instead of metrics like 'model accuracy'.Standard model metrics are used by researchers to publish papers to prove it's 'state-of-the-art' when comparing to the previous model, but it might not work for your specific use case. Talk to the business, understand what they care about. Don't be afraid if you are defining a metric that no one used before -- it means you are solving a novel problem.The model performance metrics don't matter unless it's aligned to the business goal.How do you define metrics for your data science projects?*This is inspired by Vin Vashishta, we talked about applied ML research methods on "the data scientist show" podcast.

20220708	18	During my first year at Amazon, I felt insecure about not being a 'real data scientist'. Most of the work I did was automating BI reports and defining metrics, one project was to figure out how to automate emails to send pdf from python outputs. And when I finally created a statistical model, most the time I spent was ETL other than tuning model. Although I know it's part of the project, I still feel oddly anxious about not doing enough 'science'.Then I talked to data scientists in other companies and everyone has the same experience. I realized it's not just me, a data scientist's job is not just about the science, it's everything that help the business solve problems with data and metrics. Data science could look like building  tools to help decision making; it could look like doing ad-hoc analysis that might not go into production but provide business value. Sometimes we are advisors to the business, sometimes we are engineers who automate tools, you don't have to work on algorithms to feel worthy as a data scientists.If you feel like you didn't do much, write down every small things you help solved and document the impact that you made, it might just be an email you wrote, but it helps your team make better decisions.Of course, statistics and machine learning knowledge are important in data science, but even if 80% of your work are not around algorithms but about analysis and automation that solve problems, you are still a valuable data scientist in your team. The word "science" its self is broad, there is science in data engineering, automation, data visualization, etc. If you ever feel the same as I did, just focus on the problem you solve and forget about the job title.What's your experience?*Ill share my about my experiences at Amazon in my newsletter, free to subscribe: www.dalianaliu.com 	3228	124	76	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc	{#datascience,#career}	{None}

20220708	18	Whats the difference between Kaggle competition and real-life data science work?1. Data retrieving and cleaningYou might spend >50% of the time to build pipelines to get data and clean data in real-life data science work. It's also important to decide which features to gather, which requires domain knowledge.2. The trade-off between model performance and costThe best model might not be implemented in a real-world situation. For example, the model won the Netflix prize, never got productionized because it was too complex.Does the engineering cost worth the improvement of performance? Does the new model take longer to generate results, or increase latency? You need to consider the business use case, the ROI in addition to the performance.3. InterpretationKaggle competition looks at model performance, but business owners sometimes want to understand the model in order to use it. Especially the model affects people's health or finance. Kaggle is great for you to learn and practice, but don't forget to get experience on data cleaning, and always think like a business owner.What has been your experience?

20220708	21	Infrastructure for the sake of infrastructure.Planning for the sake of planning.Hiring for the sake of hiring.OKRs for the sake of OKRs(thanks David Yaffe).All of these actions feel like progress, they feel like strategy but they often distract us from the bigger picture.The why.Another way Joe Reis  always likes to put it is, cargo culting. Doing activities to act in the right way without either understanding why or having a clear goal.Whether you're working on setting up your data infrastructure or running a business, just copying what you read about and doing it doesn't bring success.You have to know how the action fits into your companies bigger strategy.Here are a few examples of what I mean:1. If you hire a data scientists, then you should have 2-3 initiatives you can tie them to before putting out the job request.2. If you decide to set-up a data warehouse/lakehouse, then you should have clear decisions you want to be making that are currently hindered by the fact that data isn't easy to access.3. If you write an article, know what its for. Is it to drive SEO, marketing leads, or just because you want to share your opinion(personally I just need to do that sometimes, sorry not sorry).Finding the bigger why is hard and I would love to hear how you help define the why in your company's strategy.	97	29	0	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc	{None}	{None}

20220708	21	Data insights have been top of mind for companies over the last decade(lets be real, probably the last 3).This has led to many companies spending hundreds of thousands if not millions on data initiatives. Even when these data initiatives fail.Wherever you are in your data journey, its always a great idea to do some spring cleaning and look for cost reductions(vs buying another tool).So where can your team look to help reduce their data team costs?__Simplify Data Infrastructure - It's not uncommon to have solutions that provide similar functions or just infrastructure that provides 0 value for your companies current use cases.Take a moment to review what solutions and contracts you have and make sure the solutions are actually being used.__Make Sure You Dont Have Random Services Running - It's easier than you think to have randomly running services that could be costing your company tens of thousands of dollars for 0 value. Also, you might have data pipelines and dashboards that continue to run and update that no is using.This not only increases compute costs, it also adds to costs related with migrations and maintenance.For example, I recently turned off a service that was costing my client $25,000 a year that they weren't even using but it was hidden by the rest of their cloud costs.__Improve Data Workflows - In the past DBAs cared about how many bytes went into a column. This would impact how long before you would need to get a new server. Now we need to care about the gigabytes and terabytes being processed because that can massively impact your bottom line.A lot of this compute can come from views that are built on views..on views...etc when perhaps they should be a table or MV. Also, perhaps there are metrics that you only need once a week that you're processing every hour or a bad index or table configuration. All of these can lead to unnecessary data processing.__Auto-scaling - Only use the resources you need. I have seen examples of teams setting up static infrastructure that was 5-10x larger than required. If you can, set to auto-scale, if you can't make sure you pick the right size.__Data remains an important piece of many companies' strategies. It helps companies make better decisions and provides insights into what exactly is going on underneath the hood of operations.But its very easy to see costs go wild with all the various solutions, data roles, and left behind services. Thus taking time every quarter or so to make sure that the budget is allocated towards cloud costs, Snowflake consumption, and solutions make sense.Find those dashboards no on looks at and pipelines that provide no value anymore, consider getting rid of them and of course, make sure your processes are scalable and easy to transfer.How have you seen or improved your company's data teams bottom line?If you're looking to reduce your data infra cots, then lets talk.	155	17	1	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc	{#dataengineering,#cloud}	{None}
20220708	21	Over the past few years we have watched as start-ups in the crypto currency and data infrastructure space essentially speed ran their industries.Repeating the same discoveries that data management organizations like Dama International and TDWI have codified a long time ago. The need for better security and governance of data becoming very apparent as cases such as the OpenSea and Customer(.)io fiasco become public(And thats just one of the dozens that we are actually hearing about).Its easy to see why experienced veterans of the data space feel that all the tools of the Modern Data Stack(MDS) are far from new and encourage a lack of rigor or standards.Runaway cloud costs and the continuation of data swamp building from our data lake days havent left us.It hasnt been a loss though. I do believe there has been a benefit to the speed running of the data infrastructure industry. The large influx of cash and variation of tooling has challenged a lot of norms and in some cases taken advantage of new paradigms such as the cloud.And it would be a waste if we didnt take a moment to reflect how this time, its different.	148	30	6	https://seattledataguy.substack.com/p/speed-running-the-data-infrastructure?utm_source=%2Finbox&utm_medium=reader2	Article	{None}	{None}
20220708	21	If you're working as a data engineer, a data analyst, or a data scientist there are many lessons you probably wish you would have known before you started.Here are some things I wish I knew before I became a data engineer.1. Dont let the hype distract you - There are a lot of fancy terms, tools, and job titles floating around in the data world. Yeah, you do need to spend some time learning about a new tool here and there. However, I would say focusing on basic technical skills will often take you farther and make it easier for you to pick up new tools in the future.2. Create Maintainable Systems - It's easy to build out a solution that pulls data from 8 different sources at different times and utilizes different tools. This isn't sustainable and likely if you do build a system that is overly complex it will be left behind in the future.3. Source Of Truth Is Less Of A Destination And More Of A Process - The phrase "Source Of Truth" has been around for decades. I heard at my first job and quickly found out I was lied to. Creating a source of truth is often more of a process and less of a final destination. Your company will constantly be adding in new systems, switching out ERPs, and changing business workflows. All of which means you will constantly need to improve and change your "Source Of Truth".4. Save Your SQL - Whether you're an analyst or a data engineer you will likely be asked to run some ad-hoc SQL. If no one tells you or you don't have a process set up to save your SQL, you may lose it or change it to the point where you don't recall what you did. So make sure your SQL logic is being saved. Whether that is via your SQL engine or better yet through some form of version control.5. Dont Say Yes To Every Request - I still struggle with this issue which is saying yes to everyone's request. It's just so easy to keep saying yes but you only have so much time in the day. You can't deal with every ad-hoc data request and data pipeline. So practice saying no or at least prioritizing.What was one lesson you wish you would have known before you started in data?Also here is a video version!	110	13	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvCInKiLJVg&t=1s	Youtube Video	{None}	{None}

20220708	12	Distributed Identifiers : Standardized=============================Distributed Identifiers (DID) just got standardized! The goal for DIDs is to have: no central issuing agency; an identifier that persists independent of any specific organization; the ability to cryptographically prove control of an identifier; and the ability to fetch metadata about the identifier.These identifiers can refer to people, organizations, documents, or other data.DIDs conform to the URI schema:did:example:123456789abcdefghiHere "did" represents the scheme, "example" represents the DID method, and "123456789abcdefghi" represents the DID method-specific identifier.How do they work?* The identity wallet holds verified identity details of the user such as name, age, address, education, employment details, and financial information. This information helps establish trust and makes the user eligible to perform authentication. * The decentralized identity mechanism takes the public key associated with the private key and publishes it onto a distributed ledger such as blockchain. * As the decentralized system provides the public key to the distributed ledger, the identity wallet receives a decentralized identifier (DID). DID is a unique identifier representing the user across the internet.* The user shares this DID with the service provider for authentication.* The service provider looks for the shared DID in the distributed ledger. If found, distributed ledger sends matching data to the application. The user signs this transaction with the private key to complete the authentication.* The service provider application confirms the authentication success and lets the user perform the actions.The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) has rejected Google's and Mozilla's objections to the Decentralized Identifiers (DID) proposal, clearing the way for the DID specification to be published a W3C Recommendation next month.The two tech companies worry that the open-ended nature of the spec will promote chaos through a namespace land rush that encourages a proliferation of non-interoperable method specifications. They also have concerns about the ethics of relying on proof-of-work blockchains to handle DIDs. What Google and Mozilla object to is that the DID method is left undefined.The DID specification describes a way to deploy a globally unique identifier without a centralized authority (eg, Apple for Sign in with Apple) as a verifying entity.Please readDID Formal Objection FAQ document is an informative document that has been reviewed, published, and is maintained by the W3C Decentralized Identifier Working Group.

20220708	12	Data Warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, non-volatile, time variant collection of data for management decisions. - Bill Inmon If you havent listened to this already, and youre a data professional concerned with decision support activities, then you should. Especially if you missed the evolution of decision support during 1980s and 1990s. And if you think that particular history is irrelevant to what youre doing today, think again. The failure to understand that Data Warehouse is not a single product but an architecture is a primary reason that many of todays practitioners have dismissed valid architectures and best practices of the past in favor of the latest MPP cloud candy. Not every environment with decision support requirements has a big data requirement. And many who do have those big data requirements are not dealing with traditional decision support requirements, so lets stop talking about them as if theyre all under one roof. Nonetheless, there are many in each type of environment that could benefit from a broader understanding of how we got to where we are and a return of focus to architecture, standards, and best practices and away from a focus on which vendors database platform can solve all the worlds problems.       	21	7	0	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc	{#data,#bigdata,#datawarehouse,#decisionsupport,#datawarehousing,#datamanagement,#dataarchitecture}	{None}

Some believe he is the reason why a chunk is bitten out of the Apple logoin honour of Alan Turing.Ok so what did he do? Ah not muchhe just invented computer science and using his first designs he decrypted the Nazi Enigma code (the machine that the nazis used to communicate secret commands to each other in world war 2 and saved millions of lives. Pride month isnt about dancing on floats in gold hot pants.

He/she is a real jerk.)But here's the thing: I made it. It'll be out there soon for all to see. Most of the people who criticize it? Don't have the guts to do the same thing.And the next time I make similar content, it WILL be better. Sometimes well begun is half done.

20220708	23	Hurting for content? Me too. Not to worry. I take inspiration from my two favorite things: Alteryx and Abe Diaz!!!My buddy Abe inspired me to get back on my grind, doing some Weekly Challenges and getting ready for my Advanced Cert. Problem is, I was swamped today. So not much time for any heavy lifting on the ole Alteryx machine. Luckily, some recent challenges were a bit easy. So here's a simple one from 2 weeks ago. For this little guy, I had to:Clean Data (to get rid of Nulls and do all of the maths)(Formula) Sum across the rows to get the totals of food itemsSum the categories to get the country subtotalsRename a column to prep for the unionUnjon the columns and Total rowThen (in my only real nod to the Advanced cert) I did what I want to do more of - end to end production. With these weekly challenges, I want to produce an output whether the challenge calls for it or not. So I created a table and rendered it into a pdf. I also attempted to put some things on my Github like Abe did. Mixed results. I need him to remind me how to Github. We'll ramp up the difficulty soon enough!	36	12	0	https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQHxJvWgtwEiMg/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1657148389477?e=1660176000&v=beta&t=gw1lZymvt40pLBkKIKXbNxMVvhYRSWSyuOj-XkE0jE4	Image	{#LinkedinHardMode,#MajorData,#Alteryx}	{None}

20220708	23	Are you trying in vain to find a job in data analytics? Do you hear the whiners griping about the dreaded "Catch-22?" (I can't get hired because I don't have experience. I can't get experience if I don't get hired. I cant get hired because... )If you're sitting around moaning about the Catch-22, Congratulations!You've already completed Step 1: Identify the problem. Now it's time for Step 2: Find a solution. I find that usually, those that sit around whining about the Catch 22 have done nothing to overcome the obstacle they've identified, they just fire off their crappy resume over and over and hit "Easy Apply" 1000 times, to no avail. Here's the good news: There are many, many ways to get experience without the traditional Application/Resume - Interview - Job Offer process. 1. Volunteer for a nonprofit2. Do contracts on Upwork or Fiverr3. Take professionally relevant courses that require you to complete portfolio-quality work4. CREATE CONTENT - Linkedin, Blog, Vlog, WebsiteNo, you won't get paid (much) for any of these, at least not at first. The courses you may even have to pay for yourself (although there are TONS of free resources online for this as well... Kaggle is a great one. Or try Alex Freberg's project series of videos)Nobody is stopping you from doing the work. They're just not willing to pay you a salary for it yet. So the (free/cheap) labor you put in now is an investment in your future paid employment.Stop pissing and moaning about the obstacle, and find a way around it.

Thats when Piwik PRO approached me and asked to test their Piwik PRO Analytics Suit. Here are my thoughts: The installation is easy and with an out-of-the-box set of dashboards you can start your work with the platform super fast. Really liked the UI. Anybody accustomed with Universal Analytics will feel right at home here. So you can focus more on the analysis itself and not lose time on figuring out how the solution works. Its easy to find answers if youre stuck. There are tutorial videos, company blog with useful tips and an active community forum..Piwik PRO is a solution worth checking out. And There is a free version available.

20220709	9	Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Compiled and Vectorized Queries But Were Afraid to Ask.- Most modern  query engines evolved from Volcano-style iteration model and now either use vectorization or data-centric code generation "Vectorization is better at hiding cache miss latency, whereas data-centric compilation requires fewer CPU instructions, which benefits cache resident workloads."- Like the Volcano-style iteration model, vectorization uses pull-based iteration where each operator has a next method that produces result tuples. However, each next call fetches a block of tuples instead of just one tuple, which amortizes the iterator call overhead  (vector-at-a-time processing, and interpretation)- In data-centric code generation, each relational operator implements a push-based interface & the produce/consume calls generate code for a given query (tuple-at-a-time processing, and up-front compilation.)- The main principle of vectorized execution is batched execution on a columnar data representation: every work primitive function that manipulates data does not work on a single data item, but on a vector (an array) of such data items that represents multiple tuples, Data-centric compilation generates low-level code for a SQL query that fuses all adjacent non-blocking operators of a query pipeline into a single, tight loop.To Learn more around  internal concepts, join  Telegram group	15	0	0	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc	{#database,#dataengineering}	{None}

But as my skills matured I learned the art of persuasion. How to sell my ideas to leadership.And often this was based on building simple models where I could explain an incredibly complex customer behavior in a few key  actionable insights.Now what Mark and I know (and the freshers dont know) is that it will take time to develop THESE skills.

20220709	13	Here are 5 data quality issues I thought were unique to my team when I was working as a data consumer, that I realized were industry-wide problems when transitioning to data infrastructure.1. Our data infrastructure is especially bad: I used to think large-scale data quality issues were unique to our team, or that our infrastructure was especially poorly designed because I struggled to use the Warehouse effectively. Nope. Bigger companies have 'solved' these issues by throwing human bodies at the problem until it goes away. If they couldn't afford to do that, we'd all be in the same state.2. Ownership problems: This was a constant pain point I faced. 'Who owns this table?' 'Who is on the hook to fix it when it breaks?' 'Why does data engineering keep telling me they don't have context?' I felt that this lack of accountability was a unique cultural issue in our organization. Wrong again, turns out virtually every company struggles with ownership at every level of data management.3. Our data consumers and data engineers seem to always be at odds: This is common in virtually all decentralized orgs because the two teams have opposite motivations. Consumers want to move fast, break things, and experiment. Data engineers want to create scalability and build useful infrastructure. Oftentimes gaps emerge between these two groups that result in blind spots wrt critical datasets. Training can help, but purposeful collaboration is much better!4. SQL is easy, why can't we get everyone to learn it: SQL is easy, but good data architecture is hard, especially if your DW is almost impossible for skilled users to navigate or understand. Setting an untrained person loose in the DW with basic SQL is a recipe for disaster. The challenge is not writing queries but understanding a highly complex data model.5. Some companies have got this figured out: In my time working on data infra, I have not once come across any organization that said they were 'happy' with the state of data quality. Not even one time! This is very telling. We have a tremendous way to go in the evolution of stakeholder collaboration, design, and business organization around data.Businesses have put a tremendous amount of effort and thought into designing a successful model for software engineering and product management, but comparatively, little thought has been put into an effective, streamlined solution for data management, evolution, and quality. My guess is over the next ten years as data continues to explode exponentially these questions will surface much more frequently in the limelight.	240	24	9	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc	{None}	{None}
20220709	15	This is such a good article and framework from Emilie S. .  This point is key, "Given the number of questions coming at a data team, we need to be able to prioritize questions based on impact, understand what the tradeoffs of taking a task on are, and ensurewe are building to solve problems, not just building requested solutions."And yet, I would argue that far too often the data team is NOT solving problems. They are responding to requests, order takers.  How much of this is inadequate skills or legacy tech or distrust remains unclear to me.	43	0	1	https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/building-more-effective-data-teams-using-the-jtbd-framework/	Article	{None}	{None}

20220709	21	Why do we still struggle to answer basic questions like how many customers are still active or what exactly is the companys churn?This was a question posed to a panel I was sitting on at the Snowflake Summit. Several panelists provided different answers and all come from very different perspectives. Truth be told I have mulled over this question for the last few years as I worked on projects that involved reconciling basic numbers like several active customers or total sales for a company.Metricsmost would assumewould be easy to calculate but continue to plague companies even after they spent large amounts of their budget trying to build robust data infrastructure.Rarely is this due to one cause. Over the years I have seen a multitude of reasons why companies struggle to answer basic questions. These reasons range from constant turnover of developers, ERP and CRM migrations, producers of data constantly changing what data they provide, and mergers and acquisitions(of course there are still more reasons). All in all, trying to continually report even basic numbers can prove to be very challenging when the underlying components are constantly shifting, but lets discuss some of these issues and how we can try to mitigate them. 	41	21	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goT7gN1lwBI	Youtube Video	{#dataengineering,#data}	{None}

In my many years studying in university, I never met anyone (teacher or student) that I felt was significantly superior to me intellectually. In the Marine Corps, it felt like I worked with such people every day. Annalect has some amazing candidates on deck, and we've just started to talk to them. Can't wait to see who we end up with!--------------------------------------------------------------If you're planning to transition from the military anytime soon, you need to start paving the way for Skillbridge. Don't wait until the last minute, then complain when your chain of command balks at the request because you're mission essential. Start talking about it to your enlisted/officer leadership now. Let them know your intentions. Keep all your options on the table as long as possible (yes, to include reenlistment. Don't make that face. It may well be your best option.)TRAIN UP YOUR REPLACEMENT. The command still has a mission to accomplish after you're gone, and that mission probably includes a competent person filling your current role. If you can effect that turnover, you can make yourself expendable (in a good way!)Shape or be shaped, as the saying goes. And then when the time comes? They'll wish you fair winds and following seas.

If you have Microsoft Excel skills, I've got a practical roadmap for building your data literacy.Imagine a customer service manager (CSM) for a call center. This CSM has basic Microsoft Excel skills and wants to use data to be more effective in their job.This CSM can take a "choose your own adventure" approach to building their data literacy. At each stage of their journey, the CSM can answer more impactful business questions.  Data visualization for Diagnostic Analytics-> Do median call lengths vary by geography? By product line? Other factors?-> Are there discernible patterns of call length versus NSAT by agent? Business analysis with the mighty process behavior chart-> Has there actually been a change in call volumes sufficient to effect staffing?-> Is the 2nd shift truly more efficient at handling calls? Logistic regression with Excel-> Are there factors related to churn that customer service can address?-> What are the factors customer service can influence that are associated with CSAT? Linear regression with Excel-> What are the critical factors impacting staffing levels?-> Can we handle more calls with a different mix of agents?Do you think a CSM that can do all the above would have more impact at work? Would you have more impact at work if you had skills like these?Make 2022 the year you have more impact at work using data.Stay healthy and happy data sleuthing!    	28	0	0	None	Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc	{#dataliteracy,#excel,#microsoftexcel,#analytics,#businessanalytics}	{None}

Im super excited for this one as it features yet another amazing example of how were using polymorphic table functions to change what is possible in Trino.Now we can do  queries without limitation and without having to do that pesky little conversion to base 32 before submitting the query! Thats because we use the new polymorphic table function raw_query to submit a query directly to elasticsearch and deserialize and return the results as a table.

20220709	29	I was one of the first employees in Googles developer relations team, joining in the fall of 2006. Did you know that when Google started doing developer relations, the group was calledAPI Supportand underTechOpswhich was in theOnline Sales and Operations (OSO)org with Sheryl Sandberg as the org leader. What led to its prominence within Google?The name changed, of course, to Developer Operations (DevOps, which means a very different thing today!) and we had very capable leadership under Mike Winton. But I think a singular decision had the greatest effect: the move into the Engineering org. Why?Many of you have heard me argue that DevRel is marketing, so why was DevRel being in the engineering org at Google so important? Its contextual. Google is an engineering-led culture. To influence eng teams to effect change on behalf of the developer communities requires their respect.Respect comes with understanding and helping with their challenges, but also knowing their language, systems, code, tooling and operations. Access to these at Google required being in the engineering org. Also, it greatly helped that a Eng VP had to sign off on the quality of all hires.Id argue that DevRel can be super successful in a marketing group, but it requires the right culture and leadership that truly gets the role it plays in product and community success. Without that, a home in engineering is much better for all.How about having DevRel in a sales org?No, DevRel never belongs in sales. DevRel is a long game, and sales is driven by short-term lead/opp/closing targets  all sales leaders will be tempted to reach these targets by involving some of their most talented technologists in DevRel, and that comes at the expense of our real long-term goals.      other early Google DevRel folks: Mike Winton Vivian Cromwell Amanda Surya Jeff Scudder Pamela Fox Mano Marks Stephanie Liu  Arne Roomann-Kurrik Dan Holevoet Jason Cooper Brian Kennish Daniels L.
